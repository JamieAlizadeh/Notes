This repository contains Python code I wrote during the Summer of 2022.
It's organized into Python scripts that can broadly be applied to different areas of finance and machine learning.

Notes.ipynb is a fairly large file at around 3.5mb at time of writing, so it may take a few seconds to load.
Additionally, hyperlinks do not work properly on GitHub so make sure to use Ctrl+F instead of the hyperlinks when selecting sections to read.
