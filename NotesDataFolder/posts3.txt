Trying to debate the merits of both and which car would be the better value. Any opinions?

\- Living in western Montana

\- Going to be my daily driver, including to and from job sites (commercial, civil construction) up to 1.5 hours away. (Company is paying fed rate for mileage)

\- Will be used to haul materials (and maybe a small trailer) for home projects

\- Will be used to get away on the weekends to fish, hunt, hike, camp, etc.

\- Planning on only keeping the truck for 3-5 years

\- Trying to keep it in the $30k - $35k range 

Essentially I'm looking for something that gets decent gas mileage for a full-size truck (I know its hard in a 4x4), is reliable and isn't going to cost me a ton to maintain over the next couple of years. Doesn't have to haul/tow a ton, but be able to handle tools/materials for home renovation projects. And something that has decent resale value. Prefer to buy something lightly used.  

Thinking a newer F-150 or Ram 1500 gasser? But don't know if I should go with a bigger diesel b/c of resale, or stay small and try out some of the newer diesels in the 1/2 tons, or go completely sideways and buy a tundra? Maybe a Tacoma and small trailer to compensate for the small bed?

Hi everyone, I am looking to buy my first car and thought I would ask for advice. 

Info:
- Im 29 with a decent salary - but as it is my first car, im not looking to blow too much money by getting anything luxury (budget cutoff is basically the civic touring/camry hybrid $37-8k)
- will be financing regardless of the car i choose to get
- Canada
- other cars in my consideration list: elantra, mazda 3, corolla 
- i know little to nothing about cars
- needs are fairly basic.  Itll mostly be a commuter car, with occasional road trips. Good fuel economy is a plus but not necessarily primary concern. generally not a fan of hatchbacks. Dont see a need for an suv at the moment as its just me and my partner

I recently started shopping around for a new car and actually got to test drive the honda civic ex (they didnt have the touring available) which i liked. However, i liked the options that came with touring trim so was eyeing that, but realized price wise, the touring is pretty much up there with the camry hybrid le. This was a surprise because i heard camry is a competitor to the accord. I get touring is a top trim for the civic but im wondering if its better to get the camry at this point. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Also feel free to suggest other options as well!

We live in an urban area, single-car family. Two adults, one child. We don't drive much on a daily basis. When we drive, it's usually either a trip to the suburbs or a 300-ish mile road trip trip. Looking to replace an old BMW sedan. Need an SUV due to larger cargo requirements. Would prefer something nice to drive. Do not care about gas mileage.

So me and my partner are soon gonna relocate to the States from Asia. Here public transport is really good and hence we never had the need to get our own car. But its going to be different in USA and we are prepping ourselves for that transition. We are very new to driving and just completed our MT driving lessons.

We have been lurking here on this sub for months and see very helpful discussions and advise.


So today, we ask your expert opinion:

1) Apart from safety and reliability, what are the other most important qualities we need to look at for our very 1st car.
2) Gas or Electric or Hybrid
3) Any reco for us
4) Any other aspects to consider?

Thank you so much.

looking for a used car that can handle snow and is priced around $8k or less in this crazy market. want something that will last a long time. looking at all the aforementioned models from the 2000s. there are a lot of older subies for sale on craigs, tryna find ones that say the head gaskets have already been replaced. less of the toyotas and hondas, but interested in those too. what do yall think is the most reliable for an older awd vehicle?

Both seem like  great cars, not sure what the big difference is or which one is better than the other.   


The Yaris is a Toyota, so I mean I guess that speaks in itself.   


The Fit seems to have more room etc.

The car has 150k miles and the seller claims everything works just fine. I have a budget of up to $6000 but know nothing about cars.

Im driving a 6 speed manual 2014 Chevy Cruze currently and would like to upgrade. 

The only 3 deal breakers I have are: 

1. It needs a back up camera 

2. It has to be under 14,000 because Thats the top of what I can afford.

3. Probably not a dealbreaker but Im hoping for something reliable under 100,000 miles.

Ive never driven a nice sedan or crossover other than my car now that found me so Im not sure how to start looking. 

Any advice is appreciated!

I have been looking for a Honda CR-V and am about to buy a used 2017 with 60k miles for $31,000 (after taxes, fees, and everything else). The car was purchased at auction by a dealer who has nothing but great reviews online, he had his personal mechanic inspect it and make a few repairs, but I will still have it inspected by our family mechanic who I trust and he will need to sign off before I officially buy.

From doing my homework, this seems to be reasonable compared with the rest of the used cr-v market at this price range. I can afford this, but for me personally, it is also a scarily large amount of money to be spending. I've never spent anything close to this much before. I plan to finance the purchase so I can spread out the payments over time.

But I was just talking to someone who said that before I pull the trigger, I should look at how much it would cost new. I have to admit, I hadn't really thought about buying it new since I knew it would be outside my price range. But I started looking around and I am going into a dealership tomorrow where it looks like, after taxes, fees, etc, a new 2022 Honda CRV with the same features would cost about 39k. Obviously, even more scary of a number. But I could make that work financially and want to  not let fear stop me from making the best value-based decision for how I spend my money.

I know nothing about cars and feel very out of my depth in all of this. I am wondering... 1) from a value perspective, are these two options relatively comparable or is one a lot better than the other? 2) Let's say you think I should buy the new car and I instead buy the used one, how big of a mistake would I be making? 3) are there any factors I should be considering beyond the year, mileage and cost that I've mentioned. 

This is my first time posting about something like this, if I'm in the wrong place, please let me know.

So basically I am a student and I wasn't looking for pricey car, but I have a really great deal on it. I will have to pay 350$/months for the next 4 and a half year, which is kinda expansive for a teens, but the thing is that I will not have to buy insurance since it's already included, there will be no big reparations needed for at least the next 4-5 years  and I will not have to pay the electricity for most of the time so no gas price. The price in total i will pay is 16 000-19 000 with insurance, no gas price and probably no reparations. Is it worth it?

Keep in mind that I make 800$/months and I will work more during summer.

Hello, first of all, sorry if this sub is not for questions like this, couldn't find any other place.  


I am buying my first car and with the current car prices I can't really afford buying new car, so I am going for older cars. I got an offer for "Seat Ibiza hatchback 1.4 TSI 16V SC DSG Cupra 132kW" from 2011 with 130,000km driven, and would like to know if is the car reliable. I am going to drive about 600km/month.  


Also sorry for my mid-tier english.

Thanks in advance!

I drive a 2018 chevy cruze and it does every I need it to but I recently got a better job so I've been thinking about what I could upgrade to.

I really liked the dodge charger rental I drove when I went on vacation. It was fast and the leather seats and push button start were things I didn't know I wanted until I had them. I've also considered a genesis g70.

~35k for a sedan that's pretty zippy and some nice bells and whistles is all I'm really looking for. Just wanted some other opinions.

First overall question - is the diesel expected to have any considerable increase in lifespan?

Full overview of 2 cars I'm considering
- both have a 2 year CPO warranty + Standard Maintenance Inclusion

2018 Terrain Diesel SLT
PRO grade pack
55,700 Miles
$22,300 USD

2020 Terrain Denali
+ Driver Assist 1&amp;2
18,500 Miles
$29,700 USD

So part of me is leaning the 2020 because of the lower miles and increase in safety equipment.  BUT...if the diesel is going to just crush the lifespan of the gas one then I see no point in spending more $$

Let me know if there's any more helpful info I could add.

Anybody with some thoughts?
-------------------------------

Title says it all.

Subaru is a great car but its so bland, unimpressive engine, slightly dated tech, not great mpg. Great visibility, lots of room. Just so bland.

Tucson Hybrid: Really like the Hybrid 1.6 turbo plus electric engine. Good mpg and decent acceleration and great tech. Just not a fan of paying 3k over MSRP but cant find any cheaper hybrids that meet my need of interior space and rear seat legroom.

TIA for your thoughts

Hello everyone f19 here, Im looking to get my first car here in the next few months. ( Im still saving money and trying to build my credit) I have no idea what Im doing and I dont have anyone in my life that does either. My dad passed away when I was young and he was the one who was supposed to teach me how to drive and help me with all of this. My mom is terrified of driving so she refuses to learn how to drive. Driving lessons are going to cost me around $700 due to their only being one school around me that is able to pick me up from my house. I cant afford to get Ubers to driving classes for cheaper. 

So I kinda dont have a smooth start here and I have no idea really about cars besides the basic stuff. I can change a tired, I can hot wire, i know how to pump gas and check your water pressure n stuff like that. But when it comes to what good cars on the market are and just what would be best for a first time driver I have no clue. I will say that I live somewhere on the west coast so Id keep that in mind when suggesting anything, gas prices where I live right now are around $5-$6 dollars a gallon. 

Please any advice you guys have will really help me out, I want to make the best decision for me and my financial future!

Apparently the head gaskets were replaced around 100k; any way to tell if they're MLS or not? Seems like if they've lasted this long it'd be MLS, but I can't be certain.

They're asking 2500 but I might be able to get them down a bit. Does this seem like a good deal for a classic 5 speed Subie? 

I know the miles are high but it has good service records and regular maintenance. I mean at this age aren't high miles preferred since it means it was regularly driven and not just left to rot somewhere?

I have a few Priorities for a truck. Idc if its a V8 cuz gas is cheap here so it doesnt matter. It needs to be under $5000. 


1. I need an Ice Blasting AC. Summers here in Saudi are long and extremely hot (Like, well over 127 F), so an Icy AC is a must


2. Needs to be comfy, I like cushiony seats, ones where I dont break my back when I am driving the vehicle and actually have a fair amount of, well, cushion

3. Needs to have a quiet interior when at high speeds. I cannot for the life of me stand cars that are loud when driving on the highway. 

4. Needs to be spacious, I work in the Film production industry and I will be carrying lots of stuff with me, eg. Camera bags, Light stands, multiple accessory bags for said cameras, pelican case(s) for lenses, etc. 

5. Need it to be modifyable and offroadable. I like offroading and I like modding stuff. 


I am currently looking at 2 models. A 1st gen Avalanche, and a late 90s GMC Suburban. Doesnt have to be these 2 specific trucks, I am open to other options from different manufacturers.

Id like a similar sized hatchback. Cheap to run, nothing heavy on fuel. Not interested in performance but I do a lot of motorway driving and so Id like some that travels long distances comfortably (circa 50 miles a day)

I found two gx470's for sale. Let me know what your guy's opinion is. Is it worth forking out the extra dough on the 2005? Planning on doing heavy mods so the 06 would be ideal but not if the frame isnt in repairable shape.

2005 gx470 ($17,000)

* 92k miles
* frame is in great shape (previous owner lived in florida during winter so it was garaged colder months)
* tb/wp needs replaced
* new tires
* new radiator
* new front brake/caliper/rotors
* looks to be upkept maintenance wise

- stop and go (best possible)
- good visibility 
- rear legroom , space (to hold the vomiting bag)
- relatively low ground clearance ( if SUV)

Sedans, SUV , minivan, anything. New or used. Budget Up to 40k OTD.

Im hoping to have get a reduced list of options because I cant keep going around vomiting in the cars.

Beetles are more my taste aesthetically but Id have to get a 2006-2010 model to make the cost reasonable. 

I almost financed a 2014 micra (for about 4000 cash) but the APR was really high. 

Do I pay cash for a 2006-2008 beetle or a 2010-2014 micra? Both should be about 3000 max

I think Id feel joy everyday to hop into a black convertible beetle but this is purely based on looks - am I likely to run into loads of problems with an older car?

Hello, I was hoping some advise on which would be a better daily driver car. Its either a 2011 Hyundai Sonata (40,000 Miles) or a 2012 Toyota Corolla (60,000 Miles). Both are pretty much identical in price so thats not a concern. Both have a from what I can tell a good service record through carfax. My main concern is longevity. I need this car to last around 4-5 years with an estimated 10k miles added on every year. The appearance and extra features do not concern me, I just need a car I can trust to get me to work everyday. My first choice was the sonata but have heard many horror stories about its rather infamous engine ( has no recall on it, and carfax shows the engine was never replaced while the Corolla does a recall for a airbag sensor) On the flip Ive heard corollas and Toyota in general are pretty bullet proof.  I cannot decide on either but want to jump on one before they get snapped up. Thanks for any help, Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!!

Hi everyone, so like said i'm 25 years old, 6'4 and i can't decide which car i should buy. it would be my first car, i live in Canada and my budget would be 3000$ Cad. And i know a lot of things about cars. except mechanic stuff. I've some suggestions. Toyota Matrix\\Pontiac Vibe i know they are the same car it's a Corolla underneath. Toyota Camry, Toyota Avalon those are very rare under 5.000$, but i prefer the Avalon vs the Camry. Panther platform Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car.  Any Gm with the 3.8 3800 like the Buick Park Avenue, Buick LeSabre, Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Impala. I heard the Buick Lacrosse and Lucerne are also reliable, but i don't know so let me know. Acura MDX, TL, TSX, TLX. Lexux  If someone could help it would be really nice. So Thank you in advance, if you have any suggestions or anything let me know.

Here are what I've narrowed it down to:

**\~2014 Lexus IS250**

**\~2014-15 Infiniti Q50**

**\~2015-2019 Acura ILX/TLX**

I'm looking for something that I think has some curb appeal, and is a little bit on the sportier side. I also like a relatively nice interior, and the only features I really need is Bluetooth and a backup camera. Although blind spot monitoring is nice, my current car has that. 

I refrained from mentioning this in the ones I'm really considering because I know this sub but also have been looking at Mazda 3s and 6s (preferably the facelifted ones around 2018/19 I believe?). But I am definitely leaning towards the other 3 if I can find a good deal on one.

I currently have a 2009 Matrix XR with 146,000KM, no rust and no damages. I bought it a month ago. I changed the oil and put synthetic in. Changed the transmission fluid at Toyota, all around brakes were done, 1 tire was changed, spark plugs got replace this week. Current problem is my fuel gauge is off, I drove it until the tank was empty, filled it up to full and apparently I still had 1/4 of the tank left (was not empty but gauge said it was empty). Gas mileage on the Matrix is terrible, getting 400km per tank and the tank is 50L. 12.5L/100km with gas prices right now is not good for my part time student college budget..

My issue is the design flaw the 2.4 2AZ-FE have with excessive oil consumption. My car currently doesnt have that issue, but its inevitable. I want a car thats last years with little maintenance. The car idles pretty rough and Toyota said to change spark plugs and throttle body clean and itll fix the rough idle. 

The 2004 Corolla LE has beige leather interior, limited edition, and has 104,000KM. No rust or damage anywhere. Comes certified and is $6,000CAD(bit much for an 18 year old car), from a dealership. I like the inside of the Corolla a LOT more than my matrix, and the room of the matrix doesnt matter to me.

Any thoughts?

-manual (optional, but preferred)
-is good for outdoor activities (camping, hiking, climbing, etc)
-can handle mild off-roading 
-gets semi decent gas milage

I bought a 2015 toyota hybrid avalon for 9000 and got a trade in value for $15985

I have found a Jeep Liberty 2012 for 2900 dollars seems to be good - more storage and 140000 miles.

Should i Sell the avalon and get the jeep?

I know toyotas last long but I think I can manage the jeep liberty for a long time too......

 I know the market is tough right now. I'm looking to buy a spacious SUV/crossover. Looking to keep it under 28k. I'm single no kids but I enjoy going on trips, kayaking, paddleboarding..etc and sedan isn't cutting anymore. Looking for a reliable brand like Honda, Toyota..

Hey all, in a bit of a stitch here.

I currently drive a 2010 Mazda 3 (no upgrades, bought new at \~$20k) and have been interested in buying an EV for awhile. The main reason I haven't is because this car still runs well and I didn't want to spend money if I didn't have to. The Mazda 3 has 140k miles and some paint damage (rear-ended a concrete pole once but only damaged paint, some sun damage on the roof) but otherwise runs smoothly. A family member recently offered me a deal that I am deciding whether to take or not: 

1. They will pay me $6k if I get a new car by this December and give them the Mazda
2. They will pay me $3k if I get a new car next year and give them the Mazda
3. If I don't go through with their offer and eventually buy my own car anyways, I'd have to give the car back to my parents and my parents will get money for whatever trade-in value it is (so I don't get any money), or the family member would buy it directly from my parents (don't get money here either)

I checked on Carvana and $6k is on the higher end if I sold it to a private buyer, and $3k is on the lower end if I sold it to Carvana. If I got a new car, it would definitely be an EV and I have the means to do so financially. I have a stable job and would be comfortable making monthly payments on the car. I'm still deciding because while the offer is good, I haven't decided on which EV I want and I don't want to make a hasty decision. I could also buy a cheaper, used non-EV car, but I know the used car market is hot right now. 

Should I take their offer?

Budget is around 9k 

* Decent cargo space 
* Decent reliability

So, to cut it short, Im in the market for a car. I have 6K in cash and dont mind the idea of paying off a car, my max is 10K. Ive been mainly looking for something a little taller than a sedan with leg room (Im fine with a sedan as well!) in the back because I plan on having space for my friends/family. Im really fond of the look of hatchbacks. Im happy with any advice! I appreciate everyone who took the time to read and help! :)

Been in the market for my first car and came across a 2013 Ford Fusion SE sedan 4D. Price was originally 7.8k, negotiated to 6.8, listed price dropped to 7.2k. Has 100k miles

Kbb says the ask for prices aligns with the trade in value. But Ive heard fords can be money pits. My budget is 5k pushing 6k, but if its worth it Id go up. Just now sure if this is a smart buy.

I'm finally in the market for a new sedan. I've looked at my options, including the Honda Civic, Mazda 3, etc. 

The Kia Forte GT seems to be superior in most aspects. 201HP, ventilated seats, large infotainment touchscreen, etc. It appears to have very few drawbacks.

I'd like to get your opinions on why the Mazda 3 or Honda Civic would be a better vehicle at the ~28k USD price-point.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-22
Location: Southern California

Price range: $12k-$18k (willing to table purchase entirely if it means saving up a bit more)

Lease or Buy: Buy

New or used: Used (but again, in a position to continue saving if new is a better option)

Type of vehicle: Hatch/coupe with a little extra

Must haves: No absolute must haves, anything is better than my SUVs mpg. Carplay is a plus. 'Luxury' interior is a plus.

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc): Auto 

Intended use: Daily driver, 2 seats, 4+ seats is nice but not needed.

Vehicles you've already considered: Used - Mk6+ GTI, 2014+ Mazda 3, FRS/BRZ/GR86, New -  2022 Mazda 3 

Is this your 1st vehicle: No

Do you need a Warranty: If used, no. If new, yes.

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Not currently, comfortable learning.

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No

Additional Notes: I currently have very few expenses, putting away about 2k net monthly after bills and taxes. Haven't really considered a Corolla/Civic/Ford hatch because I dislike the chassis and the interiors and I'm a bit of a special snowflake. Mostly looking for a sleek chassis with a slightly more upscale interior that's fun to shoot up an onramp and cruise at night. I've browsed so many trims and models that I'm getting a bit overwhelmed.

Looking for a newer car (2018-2022) that has pretty solid gas mileage while also having ground clearance above 6.5 (I think that would be enough for what Im doing). I like to do a decent amount of road tripping while doing some off grid camping. Would like to keep it under $25k. Appreciate any help!
-------------------------------

Hi all, I hope you can help me out with my purchase decision. I have had great experience with Chevy and Toyota in the past, so they get my initial lean. My current favored options: 

&amp;#x200B;

1- 2022 Tundra - Pros: MPG, hopefully Toyota reliability. I personally like the styling. Cons: Unknown reliability with new engine, finding one without dealer markup (might have to wait a while, as I refuse to pay the astronomical markups)

2 - Silverado LTD - Pros: Maybe deals starting to pop up with new model out, maybe more reliable electronics than new model? Do you think the savings offset the less luxurious interior? 

3- Silverado - Pros/Cons - Looking for feedback. Live in California. Love the idea of the Duramax for both, but smog restrictions scare me. Don't want a lemon. Would love feedback on recommended engine for either Chevy based primarily on reliability. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will be using this as both a daily driver and camping rig (eventually a wedge camper on the bed). No serious hauling, no towing etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!!

I'm looking for a mid size truck, or at least something with a truck bed. Storage and reliability are the two key things I'm looking for. I do some light to medium off roading (camping at provincial parks, hunting, fishing and crown land trails that aren't too squirrelly) my budget is $45,000-$48,000. I'm also 6 foot 6 but fine with being a little bit cramped as I'm currently driving my sister's old jeep liberty that I revived. Thank you for your help in advance

Hi all,

Im looking for a luxury small sedan (e.g. Mercedes C300) that I can mostly count on to not have tons of (expensive) maintenance issues. I also drive a decent amount (300+ miles/week) so Id like to avoid anything above 45k miles. Current car is around 93k and had it since 2016 (several years of not using it much though). 

Right now Im in a 2013 C300. My only requirements are 

-	Leather seats, heated seats (at least the front)
-	blind spot assist
-	backup camera
-	premium/upgraded sound system
-	fun to drive.  Current car handles nicely and has a fun zip to it so Id like to keep that
-	four doors (no coupes)
-	BT audio (or CarPlay)
-	all wheel drive 

Nice to have:

-	Apple Car play
-	keyless entry
-	drive mode selector (eco, sport, etc.)

Right now Im considering an 18 or 19 C300 because thats really all I know. Though Ive also looked briefly at an Audi A4. Personally, I dont like BMWs, my understanding is theyre not great in the snow and maintenance is a bitch but correct me if Im wrong. 

Genesis is tempting as well though I dont know much about them other than that its part of Hyundai. 

Thanks!

Hiya, I'm looking for a new 4D sedan that is good for very long road trips (think 600 to 1200 miles).

The non-negotiables are adaptive cruise and lane assist/lane keeping. I would like to have total cost &lt;$34k, low road noise, highway MPG &gt; 37 and a stereo that isn't so technically complicated that I can't simply upgrade parts without replacing every single element in the sound system and loosing the talk while driving functionality. In roughly descending order of importance. 

I have a 17 civic Touring, which meets the MPG requirement but the stereo is stupidly complicated (DSP can't be disabled / custom protocol between the factory headend and the proprietary amp) and the road noise is pretty high. 

This is a tough problem because all of the manufacturers (traditional domestic) have stopped making sedans by and large. I'm think about test driving the 22 civic because I know they added a DSP option to turn off the EQ and that would make it a bit easier to fix the speakers but the stereo in the civics is still really terrible for a "premium" system and the road noise is probably high.

Looking to get a cash car. Looking for a sedan and compact suv. What would be a good reliable car for the price?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-22
With a **budget of 30K OTD**, I'm looking to buy a new but zippy/fun, relatively quiet and practical sedan for the light commute within the city and occasional long drives. I will use the car for **\~5 years**, so long-term reliability/resale value is not a primary concern. 

**Jetta Sport** is **\~23K**, **Civic EX** is **\~27K**, likely to be marked up the highest, **Kia K5 LXS** is **\~27K**

All these three have adequately similar tech, and interior quality on either isn't a deal breaker for me. Test drove all 3 and am struggling to choose one. Is the Civic worth the premium over the Jetta Sport (Just for its rear suspension and better steering feel)? Does the K5 have any cons when compared to the civic (K5 seems like the most car for money)? Any negatives in just saving money and getting the Jetta?

Considered Others: The Elantra is marked up too high for what it is, unsatisfied with Forte GT blinker locations, Mazda 3 does not have enough rear legroom, Corolla is too boring to drive. Also, can't lease cars for personal reasons.

I currently moved to CA, and left my fully restored 1968 Superbeetle in Beirut, Lebanon. Ive been thinking of shipping it here, but I have no experience in doing so. Who should I do it through? Whats the process? And how much does it cost on average to ship a vehicle?

My real question is I have a 2020 Yaris hatchback. They are now discontinued it has 57k miles on it what would trade value be. I went to my local Toyota dealership for a oil change and they wanted to buy my car from me and put me in something new. They originally offered me 14k for it but I only owe about 15k. I finally got them to pay it off with a monthly payment of $445 a month. But if its discontinued will it be worth more later? Should I hold on to it or should I trade in for a Corolla? So Yaris vs Corolla.

I got in an accident this weekend and I will be receiving 2-4K from insurance since the accident was not my fault and my last car wasn't worth much since it had a ton of miles. 

I now have 2 options for my next car. 

1 - accept a used 2000 buick with 128K miles on it for free and use it till it dies. It was my grandparents car. Would use money from my accident for maintenance. 

2 - get a used car that is newer and nicer, with the help of my family to pay for it along with the insurance money from my accident. My parents would likely pay 1/2. The car in question would be moderately priced (18-25K)

what do you all think. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Whats the best long term play in terms of finances?

Im 24 years old with a salaried job.

They are asking 17k.   
It's got \~50k miles on it and no major issues.   
I really need a car and I realize that prices are inflated right now.   
With all that said, should I go for it or pass?

Daily city driving. Budget is 20-25k. I care about how the car looks and the interior and the reliability, not a big car guy. I don't want something that feels slow though. I love how the Lexus looks, from everything I read it should last a long long time past 80k, interior is super nice, Lexus reliability. Or would you go with a new (probably base trim) Mazda 3 hatchback (0 miles!). Nice interior as well, less 'luxury', but seems to also be quite reliable. Open to other suggestions too but I've looked around a decent amount and these have been the two most appealing options to me.

When buying a car off a private seller, what should I look for? I'm buying my first used car by myself and am curious on what I should keep an eye out for. Specifically, I am looking at a 2010 honda civic with 120k miles on it for 5k, clean title. I'm thinking of taking it to my mechanic to get it checked out, but if the car has been inspected in 2022, would it be necessary to do so? Let me know, and thanks in advance.

So I am looking for a new(er) SUV. I currently drive a Hyundai Santa Fe. I like it but it sits low and I want something that is easier to drive in the winter, and can tow a camper. We also need a better car to tow our trailer &amp; side x side in when it needs to be serviced (around 4000 pounds- currently using the hubbys Jeep Liberty). I have been looking at Explorers, which can tow around 5000 pounds. My question is- if we get a camper thats around 3000 pounds, will the Explorer be able to handle it when its full? What other recommendations do you have? Ive looked at several brands online and just cant decide.

Im looking to get a new daily to replace my WRX

Im enamored with V6s at the moment and have been considering a few. 

Namely
350z HR
Genesis Coupe 3.8
G37

Im looking for something reliable, paired with a manual transmission (ideally), light on its toes, and thatll throw you in your seat. 

Theres not really any bounds Im limiting myself to though, other than a ~~$20,000 price range and not absolutely absurd insurance rates. 

Any suggestions?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-22
Im sure this is a common ask. But, my f150 is at 225 and Im seeing the end in sight, plus Im driving around 500 miles a week so Im currently spending almost 700$ a month on fuel


Anyway, I need

- rear legroom for a toddler car seat and an infant car seat

-reliable, kids in car 

-fuel costs, heres the kicker I get free charging at work. So, depending on the vehicle that may net me 300+ dollars a month in current fuel costs. My commute is approx 40 miles each way during the week. 

Obviously, the more affordable right now the better.

Ideas?

I'm trying to buy something that's   
\- reliable (preferably toyota/honda/lexus) 

\- has enough room to go to costco 

\- &lt;35,000 miles 

\- preferably manual + at least decently fun to throw around in corners (if I can't find this i'll just get a gently used prius or something) 

\- around $20k, but up to $30k for something really great 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Southern California, and so far the only options I've come up with are a) waiting around for a low-mileage 2nd gen Honda Fit or b) overpaying for a Civic Si, but I would love to hear thoughts from others.   


Thanks!

I currently drive a 2013 hyundai sonata and Im looking to buy a new or gently used 2016-2022 mid size suv. Looking for something reliable and relatively decent gas mileage is a plus as well. I drive about 25-30 miles every day between work and school so anything that wont cause me a headache over that would be nice lol. I live in Arizona where it gets 115 so also something that can handle that. I wont be planning on off roading, taking frequent road trips, or anything like that. Budget is 35k.

Looking for a reliable family car big enough for 2 kids and 2 large (45 and 70lbs) doggos to travel longish distances with, without everyone going crazy. 

My dogs are awful in the car so they move around like crazy so even if I put them in the trunk Id need space for luggage somewhere. 

Max budget is around 35k, already have a RAV4 but honestly its just so tight for those longer drives with all of us in it. 

Im not a huge car guy so Im just happy for something that works for the family and I can essentially drive till it dies!

Hi. I am currently looking at a 2019 KIA Niro with one owner and no accident history. The only thing that I noticed on the carfax report was there isn't any maintenance oil/filter changed recorded. Would that be a red flag? As well as the high mileage use since it is a 2019 car? It is currenly posted as being sold by a well reviewed car dealer.

Hey Guys,

A while back you guy helped me buy a land cruiser. Unfortunately fell on hard times and need to sell it quickly.

Its  a 1997 40th year anniversary Land Cruiser with 280000 miles on it. I am  very new to all of this, any idea where are some of the places i can  sell it online?

And any idea what i  can expect to get for it? Its in decent condition, needs a new paint  job, mechanically is seems fine, some of the things i know of are: minor  exhaust leak, minor oil leak, needs tire alignment. Other than that  everything else is cosmetic like the paint.

Thanks for all the help guys.

Yes, I know very weird selection of vehicles to compare. I am looking at both and would love some feedback (both similar prices)

The 4runner has better value retention, reliability, comfort on rough roads

The M340i has more technology, power, and excitement on the road.

I have been a car guy my entire life. I love to drive and I love everything fast. The older me knows that the 4Runner is more practical and monetarily safe. The younger me knows that I would derive little joy from driving the 4runner and long for something faster (and something that sounds better).

What are y'alls thoughts?

I am doing this kind of last minute so the only options I have are between a Kia Sportage or a Ford Edge...

The rental place does not even tell me the exact model or year so that's all I really have to go by (it says "Kia Sportage or similar" , "Ford Edge or similar".

From what I see online the Ford Edge seems to have a roomier trunk.  
Traveling with my wife, parents, and an 18 month old so there will be a few big suitcases, a stroller, car seat, etc.

I'm curious about other's recommendations for a larger family car. I've done research online, so I know how different SUVs, Minivans, etc are professionally rated but I was more curious in other's own personal experience with different cars. I'm pretty open to different types of cars. I'm not looking for any frills (like TVs in the seats) or anything. Just a reliable vehicle that is big enough that the car seat won't press me right up against the steering wheel and something that will last us a long time.

For the hybrid . Let's say u get in the car with the key fob. Without stepping in the brake, u hit the start button to startup up the electronics but not the engine. Then set the climate control on 70 and turn it on. How long will the ac run on the hybrid battery before the engine comes on automatically to recharge the hybrid battery. And how long will the engine stay on to recharge the hybrid battery before the engine turns off

**Prologue (skip this part if you want to get to the information)**

As a young car enthusiast, I am plagued by the same problems any other young enthusiast is: too much confidence and not enough money. Last night I went to go look at a $4000 288k mile 1993 MR2 Turbo that had been sitting for about 3 years. I saw the pictures, I saw all the rust, and yet my young undeveloped 18 year old frontal lobe thought "I could fix it." I convinced myself before looking at the car that it would be a great project for me to start with since it's a lot cooler than most other cars I can afford. When I got to see the car, I could already feel the buyer's remorse and I hadn't even made an offer yet. I called a much more seasoned car enthusiast friend to decide what I should offer, and when he said the car would be a "character building exercise" I knew this car would humble me in ways I'm not prepared for. I thanked the seller for his time and moved on without making so much as a low ball. Last night left me with some time to reflect; every car I've gone to see from E36 M3s to Volvo S60Rs to this MR2 Turbo has left me walking away with my tail between my legs. I've been searching so long for a unicorn, a piece of undiscovered performance for the low price of an arm and a leg, yet I've found nothing more than rust buckets and salvaged cars with fake titles.

After last night, I've recalibrated my expectations, and began searching ONLY for the cars in the list below. I've realized what I need in my first car isn't glue you to the seats performance, or breathtaking style, or clout factor--it's simplicity. The reason I write this post is because if any other teenager like me wants to get into cars without having to waste time to learn the lessons I've spent the last year learning, they should really only be considering the following cars.

**End of Prologue**

I've provided six cars below, one low-end and one high-end for each drive type category. The three low-end cars have simple, reliable, naturally aspirated, Japanese 4 cylinders with tons of cheap aftermarket support and tuning potential. Some of the high-end cars get a bit more complicated with the addition of more cylinders or turbocharging, but they all have simple motors with lots of aftermarket support in well laid out, spacious engine bays. Lastly, all six cars can be found with excellent manual transmissions that will keep things fun and engaging, while also reducing complexity.

I'd recommend looking for cars towards the top of your budget, because anything really cheap will likely have way more problems down the road that you will spend money on, and they won't be fun problems to fix. I'd also highly suggest making sure whatever car you look at hasn't been sitting and is up to date on inspection, or else you may end up with a car that won't pass inspection or has tons of rust and worn out bushings.

I know this list may seem disappointing if you've been fantasizing about that cheap E90 335i or maybe even an old Boxster, but trust me none of those will be as much fun as you think. If you buy anything faster or cooler with a teenager's budget than what I listed, you'll be paying painful insurance premiums and still end up with a car that's only working half the time. I believe these are the best cars to start with as a young enthusiast because they will be simple to work on (and modify!) while still providing you with everything you want as a teenager without breaking the bank.

Hello! Im looking for a sporty sedan car that I can work on myself, tune, and that has aftermarket support. Im looking to spend between $5k-$7k. Id like it to be reliable and a good brand. 

I already have a daily. I may drive this car twice a week, so not a ton of miles will be put on it in a short time. Id like the car to be around the 120-150 thousand mile mark. 

Ive heard a lot about older BMWs, Lexus, Acura, etc. Ive heard the older BMWs last a long time (300k+). I dont want something with a ton of technology. I want to be able to do stuff on it in my yard.

Ive been looking at Mustangs lately as a new daily car. Set on getting the 5.0 premium but my locality has a lot of diff packages. I am probably going to get a 2021 or 2022 just because any other used prices are extremely close to just buying new.

The more I look the more I see GT's premium with and without performance packs.

I found one brand new '22 GT Prem w/ Performance Package for around 49k.

But there is also another '21 GT Prem without the Perf Pack but it has the Digi Dash and other features.

Is the performance pack worth it over the digi dash because that does look really cool to me. Just not sure if it is worth sacrificing a perf pack.

Hi folks,

Our family is looking for a car within the following parameters:

6-8 seats
2018 or newer
Good gas mileage or hybrid
High safety ratings
The more storage space, the better!!


In terms of budget, we are flexible for a car that is a good investment (i.e. one that will not immediately depreciate it value as soon as we drive it off the lot OR involve lots of costly repairs/maintenance).

No bells and whistles are necessary -- we don't need a super sound system or built in navigation. A "cool" car is also not a priority. I know that I'm basically asking for a minivan. 

Thanks for your input!

Repost from [r/Volvo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/)

Hey all,

My family has been considering the current XC60 hybrid (likely inscription/inscription expression version) as our new SUV. We saw one at our local dealer and liked the overall design and aesthetic. However, we have a few questions regarding reviews seen online.

1. Many reputable websites (KBB, Edmunds, etc) have rated the current model rather poorly. Numerous complain about electrical issues, drive train issues, and of course the new google infotainment system.
2. When would the 2023 model year be coming out for the XC60? It is currently listed as the 2022 version, and it would be a shame if we bought 2022 when 2023 was right around the corner.
3. How is Volvo maintenance compared to other cars in their price range (we own an early 2010s Audi Q5 and have had quite a few issues after the warranty expired)?

Overall we like the car, but these few questions/concerns are the main reason why we are a bit hesitant to choose it. While we don't "hate" the new google UI, nothing is going to beat the technology/UI of our Tesla.

What are your thoughts regarding the other issues? Any input is very much appreciated, and thanks for your time!

1. New/used: Would like to buy new because I don't know anything about cars and don't want to get scammed. I've also heard the used market is inflated right now so might as well buy new.
2. Price: The Camry LE is 33,235 CAD + tax while the Prius Prime is 29,463 CAD + tax (the BC government provides rebates on the PP that bring down the cost).
3. Wait time: I need the car by next June at the latest so I can wait up to 12 months.
4. Space: No kids, just myself and my partner so passenger space isn't a huge priority. We do enjoy camping/backpacking so the hatchback is a plus for the prius if we are carrying lots of gear.
5. Location: I live in downtown Vancouver, BC. We don't have many highways so I'll mostly be using the vehicle for city driving. As mentioned, we will occasionally (\~5 times/year) use the vehicle for camping/backpacking trips, where we will drive 600-800km total mostly on highways. 
6. Charging stations: Our condo building does not have a charging station right now, but there are dozens of charging stations downtown, within a 10 min drive of my home. There are currently &gt;2500 EV public charging stations in BC. 
7. Priorities: reliability, cost, fuel efficiency. I'm a student and this is my first car so bottom line is I just want a cheap but reliable car that won't cost me a ton for repairs/gas. Planning on driving it for at least 15 years. I'm leaning toward the prius based on all of the above but would really appreciate any recommendations or opinions. TIA!

Sounds counter intuitive, but looking for something historically reliable yet not super boring to drive.

Currently have an old-lady find 2014 RAV4 Limited (with embarrassingly low mileage for the year and location Im at) thatll get passed on to my daughter within the next 18mths.

Currently have a new Palisade for all of our long road needs (family of 5) so looking for a runabout to work that I can fit 3-4 comfortably and maybe has a bit better rear suspension that the super harsh RAV. The RAV4 is wonderfully appliance-like to whip around, but wouldnt mind something a bit more fun than the I4 in it.

I live in a place with ridiculous snow in winter, gravel roads and terrible pavement. Budget is up to probably $20k CDN, zero rush to buy, and Im looking at anything newer than maybe 2010? 

Current thought options:

- 2012ish RAV4 Limited with V6
- 2011-2014 Highlander V6
- 2011-2014 Venza V6
- 2013 Tacoma V6 MT
- 2013-2017 QX70
- 2009-2014 Pilot 
- 2010-2013 MDX
- 2013-2017 Accord V6 (MT would be bonus)

As the title states, I am looking for a car but Im not sure where to start. I briefly went looking at cars and the one I loved, a 2020 Toyota RAV4 XLE was out of warranty and had rear and frontal damage. The bank is helping me, fortunately but I am unable to put alot down (broke college student). Where should I look to get a good deal and car? 

After that, I was asked about MRSP, gap,etc.   and everyone has their own opinions on what I should and should not get.

Hello everyone, I'll be starting law school in August in a large city that I am unfamiliar with. Given current gas prices, along with the fact that \*everything\* I pay for over the next three years will be with student loans - I'm looking to downgrade my vehicle for something that will suit my needs well.

I currently drive a 2018 Dodge Challenger, and have a $5,000 note on it. I've had a few dealerships offer me $20,000 trade credit for it (which seems about fair to me)- so I'm trying to find a new (to me), used vehicle that I can buy in order to no longer have a car payment. 

**I do not care** ***AT ALL*** **about what my new car looks like, drives like, etc.** The only real necessities I have is that it:

* Costs roughly $15,000 to offset the current $5,000 pay off I have on my vehicle, I am wanting to phase out or be very close to phasing out a car payment for the next three years
* Is relatively reliable (don't wanna buy something that is going to cost me in repairs over the next few years)
* I'd like to keep the mileage down below 75,000 miles (for understanding what used car prices might be)
* Gets "good" fuel economy (preferably in the mid to high 30s on the highway)
* Has cloth seats (I have a dog and am pretty tired of putting blankets down in my current leather seated car)
* Preferably has Apple Carplay integration (being in a new, large city... I'd like to have a larger screen for maps while driving, but I could certainly live without it.

Let me know what recommendations you all have - I could go over the $15,000 price point if everything else lines up but I'd really like to keep the price down to eliminate that payment. Below this line I'll add some additional info

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I've looked at a few different cars so far, but keep getting stuck. I looked at Honda Civic hatchbacks for awhile, but the engine oil dilution problems along with the higher price kind of ruled them out for me now.
* The newer Chevy Sparks seem fine to me - I drove one as a rental a few months ago and didn't mind it. I've found a few with &gt;20,000 miles on them in my price range. I worry about the CVT's going bad in them, but I don't plan to drive more than a few thousand miles a year over the next 3 years. They have car play, seem to work fine in the city, and could get me through school. My thought is that I wouldn't have any sort of resale value but that I wouldn't necessarily care because I will actually be making money again after that point.
* I've looked at general sedans in the price range and several seem okay, but potentially cheap. Certain Toyotas could be an option, etc.

Hi all, Im currently in search for 6-speed manual car that would have active safety features. I love driving stick, however it seems that comes with the cost of reduced safety features in some vehicles. Im happy to buy new, and Im hoping for &lt;35k. I wouldnt be against buying used as well. Thanks for any assistance.

Hello Reddit! I am currently the owner of an Orange jeep Sahara 2018 with 39000 miles and a 2020 Mazda cx30 24,000 miles with the hood and front end bashed in (my sisters car and she hit a Christmas tree on the freeway). For the Mazda, the insurance company has given us $7000 dollars for repairs and Carmax has given us $12,000 for the car in its current state. Considering resale value without damages and 24k miles is around $19,000-25,000 should I just dump it at carmax at this point? We have not checked for frame damage and Mazda was not able to perform a thorough diagnosis though they estimate we could get $9000 for it. I was also offered $38,000 for my jeep at the Mazda dealership so should I also dump that too or would I be able to list it higher on the used car market considering it is currently very hot? I know they often list for higher but I am looking to sell this car within a month. Also Im planning on buying the new jeep 4xe rubicon which will set me back around $80,000. Considering the car is in high demand right now the prices have inflated. Any idea how the value might hold up? I know this might be a lot of questions and this might not be place right place for it but I just want to maximize profits in the shortest amount of time on these two cars. What would you guys do in this situation?

Hello,

I found a 2015 Kia Optima EX Luxury that is going for 12,000 CAD (\~9279.00 USD), is that worth it?  
It has 96,000 km (60,000 miles) on it, no history of accidents, no mechanical issues, it's been barely driven from 2020-2022 because of the pandemic.

I am buying my first car and I don't know jack about KIAs. I've heard really mixed things about them. Does anyone here have experience driving a KIA optima? How reliable is it? How many more miles do you think I can get out of it? I've been seeing online that optima's average 200,000 miles. 

For a first car, do you think it would just be safer to go for something standard like a civic, corolla, camry, etc.?

The lease on my 2019 Mazda CX-5 GT with premium package is up next month and I'm talking to lenders to secure financing to buyout the lease. I have a 10,000 miles/year lease but I only used about 15K miles in total. One of the lenders is offering technology coverage for 72 months. The coverage costs $1334 and has a $100 deductible. It covers factory installed tech including display screens, audio systems, blind spot detection, cameras, etc. Is it worth it? My understanding is that Mazda's warranty on non-power train related items is 36 months, so it would end with my lease.

I'm trying to help my friend find a car for her daughter. Requirements are simple. With a price cap of $10,000 they need something that isn't going to be a mechanics special. It needs to be less than 10 years old and have an automatic transmission. Sedans are preferred. Fuel economy is obviously important.

I've never owned a car with over 100K on the clock so I'm not sure what to recommend.

The car will be used for commuting back and forth to school, maybe 50 miles round trip.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-22
So obviously this is a very strange pair, but I want to buy a project car for under 10k, preferably as cheap as possible without major issues. I would be building either car to be decently fast and good looking, which is why the difference in drivetrain doesnt bug me. For around 7-8k, would a crx or a ls400 be a better deal? Obviously an ls400 is a harder car to work on, but for 8k you can find really good examples. 

I dont want to decide based on drivetrain, size, or gas mileage, so save your suggestions pertaining to those topics. 

I am also open to other recommendations.

I have 3 boys in sports and a minivan that is fine for in-town driving but I will be commuting 4 hours, round trip, once a week starting in the fall and need something smaller and better on gas. My oldest is 11 so I would purchase this car with the intention of passing it to him in a few years. New, usedI dont care. I am not very picky about cars but my main needs/wants are:

-good on gas (would consider hybrid if I can afford it)
-under 25k (some wiggle room there)
-safe and reliable
-under 50k miles
-2016 or newer 

Any thoughts on what may meet this criteria? Thank you!

My dad has a friend who owns a body shop and we have always taken any body damage we have their, and they have always done good. But I am looking for a new used truck but I do not have  a lot of money, so 7-10k is a hard limit. I know the market is crazy right now and I dont want to get something that will constantly have issues (like my current vehicle, which at this point isnt even worth fixing). Also, any recommendations for a used 4x4 truck under 10k?

My wife and I are in the market for a new car. Our biggest car is a 2018 Corolla and that aint cutting it anymore when were traveling with 3 dogs and their equipment.

We make a good amount of money and already own a home, and when we got solar installed, we sized up on the inverter and got extra panels because we figured wed get an EV one day, so charging would be free at this point, and we just sell the excess electricity in the meantime

Our biggest concern is range. We live in a rural-ish area, so its not uncommon to drive 200 miles in a day when were visiting family, taking them out, and coming back home. 300+ range would be ideal. 

I was looking at the IONIQ 5, but theres literally 0 inventory within 250 miles of us, and theyre just as expensive Used compared to New. 

Is there any other good options that are in stock? Or should we wait?
-------------------------------

Like the title says, Im considering selling my 4Runner for something more road-trip oriented. I dont drive to work, so the primary use of the car is for road trips and often road trips to the mountains and beaches. So it needs to be comfortable and decent on gas. (Low bar coming from a 4Runner.) 

I want options with the creature comforts of adaptive cruise, apple CarPlay, and preferably with AWD since winter ski trips in the snow and hiking trips on some rather unkept dirt roads are things Id rather not give up. Price limit is probably around 45-50k, obviously the lower the better.

I love a good wagon or hatchback so options Ive researched so far are the V90, V60, Alltrack and Allroad. Love that these all have optional panoramic roofs too. Main concern with these options though is the reliability, especially coming from my 4Runner.

Any and all thoughts are welcome!

I am looking for a luxury sports sedan under $20K. Which would be a better option ? 

Currently I drive a Infiniti G35X and looking for an upgrade. I am mainly concerned about reliability since I would like to keep the car. It would be nice to have safety features like lane assist or collision avoidance etc. Serviceability is also important since I like fixing my cars.

Looking for a used midsized/large car with under 50k miles. Currently drive a 2019 Tacoma, and had a 2011 Jetta as my first car. I no longer want to spend nearly 800/month for transportation (480/month payment and over 300/month in gas), so I am looking to downsize.

Requirements

- Reliable (most important)
- Leather seats
- Back up camera
- Bluetooth/good infotainment (apple carplay is preferred but not required)
- large trunk/cargo space
Decent/good fuel economy (30+ mpg highway)

Want to haves

- good handling, peppier than what I have (Doesnt need to be a race car, but I would like something with a little bit of kick)
- Adaptive cruise control
- Heated/cooled seats
- comfortable backseat (decent legroom for an adult)

For reliable midsize sedans, it seems like the usual consensus on this subreddit is Accord, Mazda 6, and Camry. Are there any other models I should be looking at?

Is this deal worthwhile? Going to to see the car this Saturday, dealerships mechanic owned the car previously, seems like there has only been 2 owners, lived its entire life in Florida. If I take the car to get inspected, and no issues were to turn up, would the car be worth $13K? Ive seen a lot of MK3s going for more with higher miles. Any second opinions would be great.

Hi. I want a small, AWD sports coupe, and as far as I can tell there are no alternatives in North America without spending Porsche money. A used 2016 TT or TTS is around $40-45k CAD, and for that price theres nothing close as far as I can tell. Are there any alternatives? I want a good interior, hence why Im only looking at 2016+ TT/TTSs.

Recently in the market for a V6 Rav4 and came across this car:

* 2007 Rav4 V6, Limited edition
* 165k miles
* 1 owner, extensive maintenance records (verified with carfax)
* Radiator/water pump replaced at ~85k miles, everything else has been standard maintenance
* Known oil line issue was upgraded with the revised all-metal oil line from Toyota (only common issue I could seem to find with the V6 Rav4 of this year)
* No mechanical issues, body is in great condition, drove flawlessly

After some haggling we settled on $7,600. I figured for a used car of this year, this car is probably about as good as it gets.

Questions for you guys

1) Does this seem like a reasonable buy? I have no idea what to make of car prices in this market

2) Is this a reasonable buy for someone just looking for some hassle-free commuting (as much as one can expect from a 15 year old used car)? I grew in a house where we had a ~1980's Honda Civic that was in the shop literally every month, so I have a hard time shaking the fear of buying/driving a car with 165k miles now even if that's not a lot in the grand scheme of things

Appreciate your thoughts

Graduated college and starting work soon, unfortunately the site is about 50 miles one way, with 86% of the trip highway. Does it make sense to get a hybrid, or should I stick with a regular ICE?

We were able to buy some time so we sat down and discussed and we are going to increase the budget to 15k which isnt a lot but should give us a little more flexibility. We have narrowed our choice down to a small crossover or wagon and are looking at Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, and Subaru Outback/Forester. Im seeing a lot of early 2010s models of these vehicles in our price range. We have some cash set aside for initial repairs if needed but obviously would like something reliable. Any suggestions?

Hi,

I have mostly decided on getting a CPO BMW M2 (instead of proposed BMW M3) but I just want to see in a new perspective, a low maintenance sports car with 4 seats because the BMW M2 costs are still abit up there.

That said, I have shortlisted following cars (under 50k):

1. Alfa Romeo Giulia Veloce

2. Toyota GT86

3. BMW 440i (reliable b58 engine)

4. Ford Mustang GT (is this true?)

anything else i should look out for?

Hy everyone! 

I know nothing abouth cars outside that i need one, so i started thinking what car should i get. The thing is i'm a big and slow guy so i dont care for extra big engine, horse power and super fast speed, i drive like and old lady. So i'm looking for a car enough  that can safely take me from A to B without kill my wallet in gas and easy maintenance. i take any suggestion.

I require a car under maximum 10 000$, i love the idea of a small 2 door pickup just not too small i'm on the 6 feet club, i plan on using it to go to work during the week and do some outside job the weekend, 4 wheels drive and please the Gods for a low gas comsumption.

TLDR : i'm broke and i need a cheap car with a good ratio distance/gas because i'm fucking broke!

Im fine with hybrids, theyre reliable in all situations, I just dont like doing oil changes and gas prices suck. I just wrecked a volt that Ive been trying to sell, but could never find the right car, and that kinda put a time limit on my search. Slim picking with carvana and no one else near me seems to sell electric cars. Ive literally gone to dealerships where they make a face and walk away when you ask if they sell hybrids. We have next to zero charging stations, but most of my commutes are 5-20 miles. Carmax only has teslas I cant afford.

I should preface this by saying I know next to nothing about cars and my driving experience is the bare minimum to obtain a drivers license. 
Im moving to LA soon for grad school and I am told I need to buy a car within a year from now. I am thinking a budget of 20-30k for a new car and ideally if I could keep for maybe up to 10 years ish, and its very possible that I will move anywhere else in the US in ~5 years. Should I consider getting a hybrid since the gas prices in LA are insane? Im not sure if they require more upkeep but since I will be very busy I prefer something that requires least amount of attention/hassle. EV is kind of out of the question since I want to be more flexible and see myself taking road trips in the future though most of the time the car would be for commuting around LA. I think a hatchback / subcompact suv or suv would be nice for more versatility down the road. 

I kind of like the Hyundai Kona but I guess Im worried that Hyundai has less dealers than Honda/Toyota so it might be a bit harder to maintain? I also saw some posts about Kona being small so maybe I should go with Tucson hybrid..? But maybe having a smaller car is better in the city.

Also, I saw advice about how dealers are more likely to give better deals if you finance the car  is this still the case in the current market? Should I just buy the car upfront at MSRP?

Hey guys,

I am in need of a car for college and was wondering which of these cars would be a better purchase. They are both automatic since my parents do not wont me driving a manual in a big city. The e30 is 7k and the accord is 3500. I have been saving up money for a while so money is not a huge deal. They both have around 140k miles and are listed under good condition. I am looking for something reliable but fun to drive. I am just recently getting into the car community and wanted other more experienced opinions.

Hello,

I am on the market for new SUV and I decided to get Acura RDX. I can't decide between the following two models; 

2020 Acura RDX base model with 25,000 KM 

2019 Acura RDX Elite with 45,000 KM

&amp;#x200B;

Elite got a very nice interior but the base model is super low KM. Both of them are certified pre-owned vehicles

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do?

Hello! Im in the market for a used vehicle and Im feeling a little lost. KBB hasnt caught up to the inflated market prices, so I cant rely on them helping me for pricing. So, instead Im relying on the Reddit hive mind, because everyone on the internet is trustworthy.

Im comparing a Ford Escape SE with 80k miles for $13k vs. a 2014 Subaru outback 2.5i Premium Wagon 4D with 135k miles for $12k. Both in good shape inside and out.

We need a daily driver and something that can take my wife and two boys hiking, camping and road tripping. 

The Escape seems to have a lot of little issues, but is low mileage. The Subaru is a Subaru, but higher miles.

What do you think fellow Redditors?

Thank you!

From spontaneously combusting cars that took out garages, and at least the neighbors' homes too, to constantly seeing Kia's and Hyundai's on the side of the road with x problem missing, or y problem seen, etc.  Also, before READING about the known manufacturing problem of IDK maybe it was Nissan or maybe it was Kia or maybe it was Hyundai, I was told by someone who would DEFINITELY know a LOT about junk car problems NOT to get a Nissan Versa--something about the engines or something needing to be replaced.  I can't remember now, sorry!  But anyway, the point is, then I'm reading like, a day or two later, in the comment section of Car and Driver's website (one article in particular) about how it's a "pay me now, or pay me later," sort of thing with cars that are "inexpensive" up front, but then, down the road, become more expensive to own than the cars that were a little more expensive up front, because you have to factor in constant repairs and major replacements of major things.  Also, you have those that have a mileage limit (unwritten, but known by higher ups in said cars' manufacturer's company) that basically "we just have to get the car to last through the warranty," nothing more, nothing less, sort of thing!

&amp;#x200B;

SO...my "Q" to "U..." all...would be:  for those with experience in owning x model of y model or z model (and NO, I'm not talkin' 'bout Tesla, lol--auto humor), of WHATEVER brand of car, or those with experience in or knowledge in cars, could you tell me which vehicles (model, year, manufacturer) were garbage and for what SPECIFIC reasons ?  You don't have to get TOO technical--I'm car illiterate, but I get what you're saying if you say:  don't buy this, because their engines have a known manufacturer's defect, and they have a tendency to like incinerate entire villages of poor people or something, when stopped at traffic lights.

&amp;#x200B;

I would IDEALLY LOVE to purchase an AMAZING USED vehicle, however I knoweth NOT ONE amazing mechanic (to know if they'll shoot me straight or be honest with me in evaluating a potential vehicle).  In my state, this is important, because our "lemon laws" ONLY protect those who buy a NEW car that ends up being a dudd or shiny paper weight, NOT a used car!  Used cars are like going to the alter THINKING you're marrying a choir girl/woman, and ending up with the clap and finding out that her real name was Debbie, and she really DID "do" like not only Dallas, but Houston, Lafayette, and a couple of other cities in neighboring towns, villages, and assorted trailer parks as well!

&amp;#x200B;

No issue with trailer parks.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally.

&amp;#x200B;

I am like typing this...in the dark...while parked in a non-completely functioning car.

&amp;#x200B;

So like...a trailer...let ALONE an entire park full would be like...moving to Beverly Hills for me.  And even if it weren't I REALLLLLLY can't stand people using "Trailer Park" as a disparaging term, because just because your home didn't cost you like 30+ years worth of salary and/or savings, it doesn't mean anything other than....your home MAY not have cost you 30+ years worth of salary!  It offers NO intelligence on your intelligence, your character, your morality, or your level of classiness or crassness!

But like, this has nothing to do with my Original Pointsta (like Original Gangsta, but sans the catchy rap music--&gt;I actually enjoy a lot of said music, so, again, not a "disparagement," just me being corny.

  
ANYWAY:

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR (too long, didn't read), um, what cars should I STAY AWAY...FAR, FAR, FARRRR away from and why?  And what cars should I...to quote an old Whitney Houston song "run to?"

 Hi everyone,

So as the title says Im looking for a SUV within a 30-35k budget. I live in the Central Valley currently but will be moving to Oklahoma within a few months so I will be looking for a car in both places for the best deal. Some things Ive been looking for in a car are reliability, 4WD or AWD, good mpg, and with a nicer interior/exterior. 

Im not really a car enthusiast so I dont know much about what makes a car good or bad, reliable or unreliable and thats what Im looking for from this thread. The following cars are ones that I personally like the looks of, but I dont know how they reliable they are (in order from favorite to least favorite).

&amp;#x200B;

* Jeep Grand Cherokee
* Mazda CX-9
* Mazda CX-5
* GMC Acadia
* Chevrolet Traverse
* Volvo XC90
* Volvo XC60
* Chevrolet Equinox
* Buick Enclave

Please note this wouldn't be a new car, it'll be one 2-3 years old. None of the Honda or Toyota SUVs in this price range have really sparked my interest, but I do understand they are more reliable statistically, so Id be willing to consider them if this thread suggests it. Any help would be much appreciated!

Ive got an uncle who is willing to sell his 1974 Pontiac firebird with a 350 under the hood. I dont know much about the reality of me being able to maintain the car, but ive got tons of experience and talent willing to help. I was just wondering, it looks clean, minimal rust, and runs well, but is there any chance to predict how much reliability i could get? im not expecting a Toyota corolla reliability but just if it could get me to my college campus (15 miles out) at least a few days out of the week, run short errands and just be moderately reliable. Any help would be greatly appreciated truly! thank you!

I'm asking this question because I have a dilemma. I'm in high school and have a part time job. As such, I'm not making a lot of money. Around 400-500 per month even with it being summer break. With everything getting more expensive, I've been thinking about just buying a beater car with cash and having it last me through my senior year of high school. Then once I get a full time job I'll go buying a better used car. My parents would rather me have a car that lasts long term and I yeah I want that too but I can't afford it factoring in car payments, insurance, gas and maintenance costs. I'd rather have a loan-free, lower insurance and better fuel economic car like an older Camry, Corolla or Civic. What are y'all's opinions and would it be stupid of me to buy a beater car to last me through my final year of school?
-------------------------------

Just gonna preface that Im not much of a car guy, and Im kind of biased because most of what I learned about cars is from Scotty Kilmer (YouTuber thats very pro-Toyota). 

Im trying to figure out which should be more reliable/last longer. 

The Subaru symmetrical AWD is very appealing, but I dont get as much of a general vibe that Subarus are as reliable as Toyotas.

Ok so my 2000 Honda CRV just got the catalytic converter stolen and currently sounds like an F1 car while driving 5mph down my residential street.  I got quoted 1400 to fix it (hoping a family friend can fix it for slightly cheaper, but Im not counting on thatand it wold require me traveling 3.5 hours away to get the car therethough I may have to go there for another reason anyway). But with a 23+ year old car pushing 200k miles Im starting to doubt if thats worth it to fix it. Overall the car is in good condition (other than the exterior which has some dings from my tire blowing up on the freeway) and these engines are known to last forever. Really the only time Ive had to put money into it before this is regular maintenance and when my ignition system failed a few months ago. 

Im debating between biting the bullet and spending the (honestly absurd) amount of money in this market to buy a car.  I really prefer to have a car in the mid/compact SUV range. Love the Rav4 like everyone else but recently the CX-50 and Tucson have caught my attention. 

I have debated a plug in hybrid as my work has a station and I do 99% city driving. But those are all crazy expensive. I would really like to keep the purchase roughly around (or lower than 30k). I have some financial situations that are going to change one way or another soon (currently paying double rent as my GF got a job in another city, and I will either join her or get a new place) 

My question is. Do I

Option 1. Bite the bullet and just fix the cat, hoping the car lasts me long enough for another vehicle cycle or two and prices come down.

Option 2.  Try to find a cheaper lease until phev tech/prices improve

Option 3. Try to find a reasonable deal on a non plug in hybrid/standard vehicle (seems unlikely now a days). A new PHEV isnt quite in my budget but I feel like Id regret committing to a cheaper car just because of the situation.

Hi guys this is my first ever car that i will own ( ive driven allot of others from my dad)

And im deciding between these two

My two important points are reliability and economy

Which car is more reliable and economic?

For the looks i love the ford, i love the big grill and the fact it looks sporty, also the reverse camera is great since im not  good at parking.

Which would you guys recommend?

Looking for the cheapest RV towing vehicle. I don't care about mileage just reliability. Will be towing around the south. RV weight 7k max 8k. Probably will be actually less than 7k but want a buffer :).

Budget max 15k.

Will be carrying a toddler, possibly a dog, and a wife :)

I don't care if it is a truck, SUV, etc. Reliable and safe are all I care about.

I always lurk on this sub just bc I like cars. But now that I'm looking for something I'm having information paralysis lol. I'm looking for what y'all think is the best commuter car for around $6k with MPG &amp; reliability as the main factors. Next factors would be drivability and resale/depreciation. Interested to hear what y'all have to say and I'm totally stuck on what to do

These two cars are close enough in price and I love them both. I haven't been able to find the BMW, but I have been in the Golf R and even the new GTI as well and I loved the Mk8 Volkswagen platform. But I also have been looking alot at the M240i. Can anyone give me some insight to each car and what the yearly expense would be for both? I would imagine the BMW being over the top expensive to own compared to the Golf R but maybe I am wrong? I've never owned a Volkswagen or BMW only have had Fords. For reference I'm currently in a 2018 Mustang GT that I will be trading out of.

My car, a 2011 CRV, just got totalled out. Im getting 9k from it, and can comfortably put 10k down.

A local dealership isnt adding any adjustments, can order a new Cross L for 24,960+TTL. 

I make about 45k/year, can get my payments down to ~250 a month. 

I can also buy an 09 CRV with 180k for 6k from a family friend. Not the greatest, but its enough car for what I need &amp; should run through the next few years, to wait out this market. 

Any advice?

Type: compact/mid-sized luxury sedan or coupe  
Budget: \~$45k (can go slightly higher as well)  
Use: don't expect to go over 10k miles a year

looking for:  
\- automatic transmission  
\- all wheel drive  
\- best in class safety + drive assist/autonomous features (360 degree parking view, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitor, lane keep, steer assist, etc.)  
\- android auto support (digital gauge cluster + infotainment system)  
\- heated + ventilated seats  
\- premium audio system  
\- sunroof

Prefer a car whose value doesn't drop off a cliff as soon as I drive it off the lot (I plan to keep it for 3-5 years).

My previous car was a fully loaded Elantra Limited which I really enjoyed. I had an accident resulting in total loss. Instead of going for another Elantra, I was thinking of getting an upgrade. Going through the websites of the usual suspects (merc, audi, bmw, acura, volvo, etc,.) I feel like I'm not able to make a good choice.

So far I liked the 2022 Mercedes CLA, which apart from being on the higher end of my budget (with the options I want) and probably the worst looking Android Auto implementation I've ever come across, seemed good and checked most of my boxes.

I was looking for suggestions similar to that.

I recently had my Honda Accord wrecked it was a 2004 and ran just fine. My question is are there any other reliable cars like Honda Accords that are around sub 10k on the used marketplace?

Im thinking of saving up to get a project/dd car but not sure what I should look for. Currently ive been looking into getting an e36, 240sx, golf, or a miata. Out of these any 240sx would definitely be my favourite but heard their unreliable and theyre getting expensive. Anyone with any of these cars or other cars similar to these have good/bad experiences with them?

I have had reserved a Rav4 Hybrid and a Sportage Hybrid considering both have a long wait times for delivery. Got calls for availability for Rav4 Hybrid (arriving early Aug) and Sportage Hybrid (Mid July)

I would have preferred Rav4 XLE Premium or a Sportage SX Prestige but in these time you take what you get.

I like the new tech features in Sportage EX minus the missing adaptive cruising. However, two things do not favor KIA in general:
1. Newer first year model 
2. Past reviews/news about reliability

The Rav4 looks dated at least from the interior and gets far less features for the money but has a better historical reliability.

Both are at MSRP with some reasonable add ons.

I think the format that r/cars uses is good so I'll use that 

Location: Southern US

Price Range: 1.8k-9k usd

Used or New: Used

Type of Vehicle: compact, sub compact, anything small

Must Haves: cold AC, shorter front 

Desired Transmission: automatic

Intended Use: daily driver 

Vehicles you've already considered: Scion IQ (none currently available near me), miata, mini coop, Beetle

Is this your first vehicle: yes

Do you need a warranty: no

Can you do minor work on your own vehicle: yes

Can you do major work on your own vehicle: no

Additional notes: I'd prefer a smaller car, at least something not boaty or has a shorter front. Also there's no one helping me pick something out and I'm not a car girl, so if you have any tips on green/red flags on listings that would be appreciated.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-21
I dont know about many types of car but, I do know some of my preferences and was hoping you could help me add to my list so I can consider as many options as possible. 

Location: Southern Midwest, USA

Price: 20-50k

Looking to buy either a new or used automatic comparable to an E90/E92 3 Series (If used after 2010 would be preferable) Bluetooth, RWD, at least 18 mpg on city streets, and stiffer steering (not sure if this detail is adjustable but just in case it isnt).

This vehicle will be intended for light daily use and occasional long distance driving (~200 miles, every 2 weeks) so, reliability is relatively important to me

Vehicles currently being considered: (New) Lexus RC / WRX / KIA Stinger, (used) 3 series wagon, (2020) m304i, (2018-19) 330i / M2, (2014-15) Jaguar xj, (2012) cls 550

This is not my first vehicle and I can do minor work on my car.

Additional notes: aesthetic is quite important to me but, I lack the vocabulary to properly explain myself in the technical car body description. Mean but in an unassuming way would be my best attempt at description.

Being fun to drive is extremely important to me as well as comfortable to drive for longer distances. Price is also negotiable but preferably able to round down to roughly 50k.

I live in Alberta Canada, so theres snow and ice for half the year. I want to buy a car for at most 4k, I cant drive manual (I would be willing to learn but no one I know has a manual that I could learn with) so automatic it is. I live in a small town so Id probably mostly be doing highway driving until I move to a city in a year or so. I want something dirt cheap to insure and fill, but is also reliable on long highway trips, does anyone have any ideas on what would be a good car for me? I love Toyota celicas but theres not many automatics, and the autos I have seen are pretty beat up.

Hey guys, first of all I'm new to posting on reddit so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. After going back and forth about what to do with my car for a while I've finally come to reddit for answers. My car is a silver BMW  E46 coupe with a 2.5l engine. It doesn't lack any comfort or power, but I  just don't think it is the best looking car around, and I want  something else. Now I can do four things:

\-I  can sell the car, however, I'm not sure whether I will be able to buy  something back with the same level of comfort or power (although less  power won't be a problem if I like the looks of the other car more). The  problem is that my budget would mostly be the money I get back for  selling it, and because it has high mileage (around 320.000 km), and  some rust, dents and scratches, I think it will get me 3000 at most,  probably less. I'm afraid I will eventually be sorry of selling it.

\-I  can keep the car (the way it is). Maintenance has always been kept up with, it has new  tires and everything works the way it is supposed to, so the high  mileage is not a problem for me. The problem here is that this idea of wanting something else keeps sitting in the back of my head if I keep  the car.

\-I can also try and  customize the car in a way which makes me like it more. For example a  small spoiler, different rims and some interior changes. This however  might cost me a lot of money and will possible decrease the value of the  car even more. And it kinda doesn't sit right to me to change a car  like that which is in quite a good and original shape for its age - also  because I'm not sure whether customizing it is gonna make me actually  like it more, especially with my low budget (f.i. wide body kit or  giving it a paint job is not really an option).

\-The last option I have is buying another, cheaper car. It would probably be something like a 1984 Mazda 626. It will be cheaper to drive than the BMW, but it might also be a less fun driving experience (possibly less comfort, less power, fwd). In this case I can save money for a different car a bit faster while still having a car, but here I'm also afraid that I will regret selling the BMW. Or I might start customizing it but in that case it will still cost me money.

What  I would like to buy is either a Japanese car, some boxy coupe or sedan from the 80's, or an American car with v8 engine from the 60's or 70's. However both these kinda cars are kinda expensive where I live, and selling my BMW is not gonna get me any of those two in driving shape in at least a year or two, and I'm afraid I won't be able to keep myself from buying something else for that long. 

I hope someone can give me some advice on what to do.

*TL;DR* In doubt about selling car or keeping it, afraid I will be sorry if I sell or customize it

We were in a car accident a couple of days ago that totaled my mom's car (a 2018 Mazda CX-5). We are all okay. The deer...not so much.

Now my mom is in the unenviable position of needing a new car in the current market. She's long said that her next car will be a hybrid, ideally a plug-in, although a regular hybrid would do. She needs a small SUV (or equivalent size), since she lugs big baskets of laundry around for her work.

Unfortunately, the market is tough if you want a hybrid right now. The markup on small SUV hybrids these days is enormous, they're hard to get your hands on in our area, and the wait for new plug-ins is  loooong (on the order of years  in our area, at least). It also seems like additional options (like the Honda CRV PHEV) will be hitting the market in the next couple of years. In light of all that, we're guessing it's best if she waits for the market on hybrids to be a bit more favorable, since she doesn't feel like she has to have one right now.

Here's the question: **would it be better for her to buy a new or used car right now, if she knows she's going to want to get a hybrid in a few years?** My mom has mostly bought new cars and driven them into the ground, though she's open to buying used if it doesn't have a ton of miles and has been maintained well. But we've had a few people say recently that in the current market, used cars are not necessarily the good deal they once were, and you're almost better off buying new these days. Thoughts? TIA!

2010 Honda Civic DX-VP with 62,000 miles that appears to be well maintained. Previous owner drove very low miles every year. From 2011 to 2015, they only drove 30k miles. Odometer history doesnt appear to show any indication of odometer tampering. Just wanting to see what you guys think. I already test drive it and it it drove just fine.

Its the worst time to be buying a car but Im looking for something very reliable and affordable, and I think I just found it.

Hello. Was looking at an Audi A4 2013 1.8 TFSI with 10 000km on it. It's a petrol with timing chain. I did quite like the car and the listed price is resonable imo (11500 euro)

Im a car novice but I was wise enough to buy an OBDII scanner before meeting the guy today. There was no check engine light however the with the scanner two error codes came up

P000A
"A camshaft position Slow Respone Bank 1" 

and 



P000A(Pend)
"A camshaft position Slow Respone Bank 1" 

So its showing up twice, once as pending?

From my googling I understerstand this code can be quite bad? Or am I overreacting because I have found a car with a single fault code?

Should I try to stay clear of this car at all cost? 

Or should I try to ask him to go to a shop and let them have a look at it? Idk how convinced he will be to do that though since there is no check engine light

Hi, 

I am a 19 year old guy that has a 15 to 20k budget to buy a first used car that I would like to keep through all my years in med school. I would like to know what you guys would recommend. I am looking for SAFETY first, then good handling and a simple good-looking modern design. Lately, I've been interested in the Mazda 3 2014+ the CX-3 2017+ and the CX-5 (even though I feel like it must be a bit too big for a solo driver student). A lot of Mazda's, I know (I love the design and they seem very safe). However, I don't mind if you guys have other car brands as a recommandation!

Thank you in advance!

What should I look out for? I checked what services it had, no issues on the last MOT

Hi folks of /r/whatcarshouldIbuy!  I just had my 2014 Chevy Cruze LT written off in an accident and I'm looking to replace it with something similar.  I don't do a ton of driving, mostly city driving with a road trip once or twice a year.  It would be nice to have something with more space to carry bigger items and I really enjoyed my Cruze's turbocharged engine.  Ultimately though I'm interested in reliability over luxury.

So far I've mostly been looking at sedans similar to my Cruze, but I'm open to the idea of a smaller SUV.

My budget is $35 - 40K CAD, but 40 is probably pushing it.  I've checked out Mazda3, Corolla, Civic, and HR-V in my area and I'm open to going new or used.  What do you guys think would be a good car for me?

Hi everyone, I am in an interesting situation. I am a high school student and my parents offered to buy a small safe new car for me as i am a novice driver, however, in a couple years when my driving skills have progressed, I will get another carWhat car around or under 25 thousand do you all recommend?

I guess reliability wont count too much since I wont have it for long?

I would like all the main safety features, and adaptive cruise control.

I am currently looking at these cars:

Kia Forte GT-Line with technology package

Honda Civic EX

Subaru Legacy Premium

Toyota XLE? (if i get msrp)

please feel free to suggest other cars, i appreciate your input

(no mazda lol, im thinking of getting one later)

I am currently looking for a new manual car that will last me awhile. Ive been looking all over for Hondas but am finding them to be at least $17,000-18,000 for anything under 60,000 miles. 

My first car was a somewhat shitty old Jetta and I personally loved it. Ive noticed that I could purchase a new Jetta for somewhere around $22,000. Would it be worth it in the current market to go new? 

Reliability is what Im looking for... but with the current costs of used cars, especially used reliable cars, I am wondering if it is best to just go new.

Is this a good buy? 110k miles, it seems very affordable but I'm worried about the dangers of a 16 year old car. Her dad has kept it maintained, the only real things I notice wrong with it is that it has a lot of "road noise" and the wiper fluid doesn't work. I was thinking about just buying it and getting it checked out at a local mechanic or something. 

I currently don't have a car at all, we share hers and I offered to just buy it and she's gonna get some newer fancier car.

Hey all, I'm looking for some advice on what used car to buy for around 15k (UK based)

I'm not sure what to go for, electric cars are too expensive, diesels are being phased out, petrol is sky high prices. I don't need a big car, preferably I'd want something that's decently economical, good tech and a bit of fun. I've been looking at 2015 audi TTs but they're a little too pricey so alternative options would be nice!  Mostly looking at hatchbacks and coupes as I don't need a saloon or estate size vehicle

Thanks in advance!

I plan on getting a salvaged car that is newer than my current one with less miles. I will use something known as Snap finance to repair it, last time I used snap finance they pre approved me for like $2000. How do I know which car to pick to make sure the repairs arent anything too expensive? Would picking an older car be safer? Should I make sure the title is clean, wouldnt a clean title mean the insurance company hasnt been notified and its possible the repair costs arent that expensive?

I want something fun and something I can keep long term, and comfortable.

I currently have $1000 down a dealer allocated intense blue Elantra N, but am second guest myself after seeing a new Veloster in person. I am a married 24M that doesn't plan on having kids for at least 5 years and want something fun to drive, but I don't know a lot about cars so I would appreciate your all's opinions.

I'm a single 26 y.o, who moved to another city for a job that pays 70k pre-tax. I don't have a car righ now because I really didn't need one while living in a big city with a decent public transit system before relocating. However, to my surprise, public transport sucks and is utterly unreliable where I moved to. As stupid as it sounds, I've been relying mostly on uber rides to and from work for the last 2 months. Also, I do 300-mile-long commutes by train for family and other commitments almost weekly. I'm in desperate need of a reliable car. Pls see my reasoning below and advise if I'm being stupid for wanting to finance a new Tesla Model 3 for 60K. 

My needs:
- 300+ mile weekly travel excluding side hustle (see below)

Reasoning:
- 100% sure I'm going to drive an EV 3 years from now, so if I go the ICE route, it'd be only a lease for me
- having a hard time justifying an ICE vehicle with a $500 + monthly lease, with range liability for the next 3 years

My financial situation:
- 70k income, 1.4k rent + bills, 15K student loans. 710 Credit history. 
- Also, I'm getting promoted at work in a few months which will add another 10K to my income. 
- planing to do side hustles with a car and pocket at least 1K/month after taxes

I was planning to get a hybrid initially, but there are up to 4-5 months of wait time until I'd get the models of my choice. However, I'm seeing estimated delivery of Teslas around June-August 2022. Of course, I realize there're going to be delay anyways... 

I will consider all opinions and suggestions. Thanks!!

Serious question, not trolling. Why would anyone choose a gas guzzling luxury car like mercedes when you could drive a Model S with double the horsepower and features? 

I mean, a Model S literally beats a Lamborghini in speed and horsepower and its 5x cheaper. So why are sports cars still hot today?

Looking at one for about 17k with 128k miles. It's a titanium AWD trim.

I wanted to get a 328i but the interior quality was a joke and I want something that is fun to drive and also luxurious. Love the interior of the fusion titanium.

The fact that it is awd worries me. I heard that AWD can be a problem with fusions. Is this true?

which is a 2012 Honda CR-V EX-L with 157,000 mile, which seems reasonable to me for a ten-year-old car. Is my credit union, right, though - should I look for something else? I really wanted an EV, but they just aren't available in my price range. So I'm really just looking for transportation for 3-5 years till there are more EV's and maybe the auto market settles down.

Currently looking these two different models. I'm drawn to the ruggedness and reliability of both vehicles but I'm curious which one you guys think is a better buy. I'd use it as a daily driver, and need something that can handle snow and is comfortable on long drives. The size is good since I need to fit a car seat in the 2nd row and stroller/etc behind it. Budget is about 35k-40k so it would certainly be a used model. Any advice?

I dont currently own a car. I uber / ask people for rides. Looking to finance a new car. budget is less than $45k. My rent is ~ $500 per month. Credit score of ~ 700.

Firstly, should i even buy a brand new car with no trade in, at this point of tim with the markups and upcoming recession? or go for a used car? If i can buy a new one - how much should i be spending? based on my earnings, whats the ideal amount? 

Current plan - 

Since im currently single, will get a fun performance car like a 2022 challenger GT, drive it for a few years and when i want to marry and settle down with a family, then sell this car and get a more practical family suv. 

good plan? or straight up bs?

Recently got into an accident that totaled my 2021 Mazda6, and Im looking to replace it. Im looking for a car under 45k so I can buy it outright cash, otherwise Im willing to put 45k down and finance the rest up to 65k.

Looking for a premium small- to midsize-sedan, honestly I loved my Mazda6 for the most part but I was less than impressed with the fuel efficiency and the outdated infotainment system compared to my older 2019 Mazda3.

I definitely like a comfortable, sporty ride - fuel efficiency isnt a HUGE deal but with current gas prices Im leaning that way. For reference, Ive been looking at the new Civics, Accord/Accord Hybrid, G70, Audi S5, TLX Type S, etc. but at a certain point they all just start to blend together and its hard to choose one. Looking for recommendations and maybe experiences from people who have been in similar situations. Thank yall in advance!

So we all know that the car market sucks right now, and that has put me in a bit of a tight spot. I have a 2012 focus fully payed off I got as a hand me down from my family. Of course it is the automatic that has the awful DCT. The clutch has already been replaced once under warranty, but now it has 115,000 miles and no longer covered. Twice this month the transmission has overheated on the highway and it drives terribly and dangerously. 

With the cost of cars now it may be cheaper to "fix" the transmission, but with these cars it will inevitably break down again. I could swap it out and get a used car, but prices are insane to get basically anything decent and reliable - I'd rather not get hosed. I really don't want to spend more than like 10 grand on a used car. Also I would prefer good fuel economy with the price of gas right now. 

Some used cars are going for so much it almost seems to make sense to get a new car, but I would never pay for a new car under different circumstances. I only make $50,000 a year and recently got out of debt, with meh credit, so it seems hard to justify buying a new car for $20,000+.

So what do you guys think is the best bet in my situation? All I want is reliable transportation, and my daily commute totals 65 miles. "Fix" the focus and wait for a better market? Buy a used car? Or get a lease on a new corolla or something like that? I've never bought a car before as I have been driving this focus my entire adult life, so it's hard to figure out what is a good move financially

Hi everyone, I'm looking for a CPO Rav4 or CRV, have done a lot of research but wanted your opinion about which one I should get.

For context, I paid about 15.8k back in 2020 when cars were dirt cheap. I have decent credit score and income for the price range. Currently, I owe about 13k even making $330 payments per month on it.

The Veloster in question has about 17k miles on it. My only hesitancy is whether if it's worth upgrading from a 2018 to a 2019 or should I just wait.

I drive 90 miles a day for work, all highway. 

I would prefer new.  Sedan/hatchback, prefer mid sized as I have a 6 month old. Wife has a Honda pilot so don't feel an SUV is needed. (Although I'd highly consider the RAV4 prime if it was possible to get one). Located in Ohio.


Right now I'm looking at the 22/23 camry hybrid.


I currently drive a 2016 wrx that I'll likely be selling.(big sad)


Have a garage that I could install a charger in so possibly interested in ev/plug in hybrid.


Would love to hear some other recommendations to look into.

I'm looking into buying an SUV for my next car and my question is this - what is the most fuel efficient and long lasting SUV I can get? I don't care about how old it is, I just need something that will last me atleast another 10 to 20 years. Bonus points if you can find a car without one of those big, ugly infotainment screens.

Currently am 2.5 years into a 3 year lease. 2020 BMW M40i. Can buy it at $40K, which is a good deal as they are going for over $50K with these miles (25K miles so far).

I don't put a ton of miles on the car. Probably hit the 50K mark in about 3 years from now. I've had a BMW in the past and it was a bit problematic past 50K miles but once I fixed things it ran really well. But I don't enjoy mechanical issues. 

In my range right now are offerings from Porsche and Mercedes, but I don't like them any better in particular. Big fan of the M40i though would love electric at some point, but going to wait until the infrastructure is a little more built out. 

Anyway, what do you all think? Thanks in advance, this sub is awesome!

Ive considering one of these trucks as an option and Ive always had a preference to older cars/trucks and really appreciate this body style. I know the 350 sb in these thing are quite indestructible and will last a while but Ive heard the 4l60 is kinda shit.

Looking to get into a newer (hopefully 2010+) and more practical car that's still fun to drive, so I'm looking for some suggestions, opinions, or any cars I haven't thought of yet! I'm coming from a 5 speed 2005 V6 mustang that's been my daily for nearly 10 years. I still enjoy it but its starting to develop a lot issues and I'd really like to have a little bit more practical storage space. My wife already has an SUV so I've ruled that out, and I really like the style of hatchback and wagons over sedans. I still would love a manual because I love rowing my own gears, but I won't completely rule out auto. I'm really open to all car brands so suggest away! 

Some cars I was considering:

Focus/Fiesta ST

2nd gen Mazdaspeed 3

VW GTI

Hi so me and my girlfriend are not good at picking cars we have gone through three cars in three years. The first was a 2003 mercury sable gs that I got from an old coworker that lasted the winter and spring and then found out it was a death trap the front axel had been so rusted that the guy who looked at it was surprised we had driven on the highway and it didnt come off. The second was a 2005 Subaru Forester that we got from a automotive dealer shop and it drove fine but after awhile we had to get the flex tube fixed and my mechanic said the subframe was rusted to crap along with the left wheel baring on the drivers side. So then my girls grandmother gave us her car a 2009 Chevrolet HHR LS it had been sitting since her uncle got into an accident and her uncles father said he fixed it but there have been electrical issues and the ac hasnt worked and other stuff  and we brought it to our mechanic to get the flex tube fixed on that and he said that to get all of it fixed would be a pretty penny and it would be better to get another car. So we dont know what to do. we are looking for a car that is gonna last us a couple years or longer. 
That is good on gas. 
4 door
4 wheel drive would be nice but doesnt have to have it
Not necessarily a truck but an suv is fine also
I got used to big open trunks so I have no problems with them
Should we get another used or just buy a straight up new car?
If used what kind and type of cars do you think are the best?
If new same question
Any opinions are welcome

Hi all. Currently drive a 2016 mazda 3 with 55K miles snd looking to buy a new or really reliable certified pre owned turbo charged car that i can afford. My budget is 40 K but i can push for 45 K.

My mazda dealer offered to buy my mazda for 13 K in exchange for new 22 mazda 3 2.5 turbo hatchback. Now I really really love mazda, probably one of the best cars i have ever driven and im a huge 22 mazda 2.5 turbo fan too so definitely considering that offer.

But im Willing to consider other sports sedan like Accura TLX etc.

Just not sure which reliable turbo charged cars to go for? Anything that is under 40 K or 45 K where i can exchange my 16 mazda 3 as well?

Again, i love driving a fast car but need a daily driver which i can occasionally go crazy fast with.

Thank you all

Okay so this isn't the typical post here and I'm not sure If this is allowed but here it goes. 

I bought a 2014 Lincoln MKT with 70k miles on it for $14,500 from a private party. I thought the person was trustworthy but apparently I'm just too trusting. He was a retired music teacher who bought the car brand new.  


On the ride home the vehicle has catastrophic engine failure. I brought the vehicle to Ford to see what was the issue. Turns out it needs a new engine to the tune of about $10,000 along with (probably) new turbos. This seemed high so I consulted 2 other shops in the area. Both said the same thing. One didn't want to touch it and said just have ford do the work. The other is booked out for months and does not know when they would be able to get it in. They also don't think they could do it for much cheaper. Ford can get it done in a week. 

So I'm into this driveway decoration for $14.5k. Should I suck it up and let ford replace the engine and be in it for $24ish and atleast have a car with a new engine and 3 year unlimited miles warranty? This is defiantly on the way higher side of the prices these cars are going for but would atleast have a new engine and warranty. Or should I cut my losses and see if I can at least get a few thousand for the vehicle and spend that + the 10k on a different car. I really dont want to have to lose 10k or more on this. Every thing in that price range seems to have well Over 100k and is not really what I want anyway. 

I bought the lincoln because it has: 3 rows, a ton of features, like ac seats (its hoottt in the south) lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, panno roof etc. And it can tow a small trailer, and has some decent power to it.  It would be a little more fun to drive than a regular, taller suv. Ive had some sporty hatchbacks before and loved them. Golf R, r32 and a few others. This seemed like a great step up in size from them but still fun. It's definitely a weird looking car but I like it. I've consulted a lawyer but don't have high hopes of getting my money back.

Hey there, looking at one of these two cars as a potential track beater/nice street build.  I already have a reliable daily (mk6 GTI) so I don't need to worry much about daily-level reliability.  This will be a project purchase.

Some details:

MR-2:  288k on the dash, original drivetrain/all stock, does not run/has not been started in several years, has some surface rust on the body panels and some serious rocker panel rust.  $4k OBO.

RX7:  109k on the dash, original drivetrain/one owner, runs and drives perfectly well, some minor issues (AC condenser, exhaust leak, paint fading, etc.), NO RUST, etc.  $5500 firm.

Both cars are 5-speed cars with clean titles.  I'm looking for a car that will give me that lightweight low-power track experience that will actually teach me how to drive, not just to press the gas pedal.  I've attached pictures of what I think are the best pictures of the cars and then of their flaws.  I have a lot of time and am in no rush to get either car running, and I am working on a somewhat flexible budget.

What do you think?  Thanks.

I am planning on buying a car this year that Ill have for a long time. My budget was originally about $18,000 but looking around Ive noticed that a new Civic really isnt significantly more in the grand scheme of things. Most of the used civics cars Ive been finding at this price range are at least 6-7 years old, and at this point Im wondering if itd be better to just bite the bullet and buy new?

I know Civics last forever, but in todays market Im wondering if it may just be more worth it to buy new? I want to have whatever car I buy next for the vast foreseeable future.

In this strange world where buying a 3 row SUV that doesn't cost an absolute fortune seems like finding a unicorn in a field of gold coins, I've found myself in a position of having three choices in front of me - a new 2022 Mazda CX-9 Carbon Edition for $46k, a used 2021 Honda Pilot EX with 23k miles for $36k, or a new 2022 Honda Pilot Sport for $40k. 

I want a fun, sexy car to drive, but ultimately just need a safe, reliable, family friendly vehicle - bells and whistles optional. I'm in Colorado and get to the mountains a few times a year. I can't wait any longer and need to make a decision in the next day or so (no time to order and wait). Any advice on the Honda Pilots or just go for it with the CX-9? 

Other things I'm wondering about - the CX-9 is a V4 engine, while Pilot is V6 - how much does this matter? And would I still get good performance out of the CX-9 without premium fuel? 

Really appreciate any insight!

How are people able to afford cars at these prices and interest rates??

Read an article that said the average interest rate for used cars is at 8.2% and 5% for new cars! 

like what the hell. I recently graduated college and landed a good first job starting salary 60k. but even with a salary like that, its difficult to justify buying a car at these prices and interest rates. 

and Im not even talking about gas prices, how are people doing it??

* In no major rush to upgrade with prices are where they are now, yet I have plenty capitol saved up and thinking ahead.  

* 30M Located in USA, working in CPG Field Sales, so a good amount of time in my personal vehicle and this next purchase would be one I would like to keep for 10+ years likely.

* Currently drive 2013 Ford Escape Titanium FWD Ecoboost w/ 140k mi - top trim is a must for me...premium audio, leather, ventilated seats, etc. 

* Want a larger SUV (3rd row seats not required) that's not an eye sore and comfortable.  Open to all suggestions and appreciate feedback - Highlander Hybrid Platinum is what I've been looking at the most lately.

I'm moving to a rural area and most people here seem to have a 4x4, awd, pickup trucks and crossover SUV's. I would opt in for the Ford Bronco but there has been an engine recall on it so I'd rather wait. 

Some of the options I've been considering is the VW Atlas Cross Sport, Toyota Tacoma, Acura RDX, Ford Bronco, Hyundai Tucscon PHEV. 

My budget is probably around $30k

Between smoothness, quietness, pickmeup, and "funness" lol

I am coming from a Mazda 6 that is super fun to drive and comfortable. 

I've always had a small car or sedan. Will the driving experience of an SUV never compare?

I gave a big year range because I'm trying to figure out my budget. 

I will eventually get to test driving, but if I'm not trying each vehicle all the same day I may not trust my own opinion 

I've test drove a Grand Cherokee and really enjoyed the pickmeup and smoothness of the steering. Test drove a new CX-50 and it was very MEH to me. 

Drove my friends 2008 Highlander and drove pretty damn well! Comparable to the GC, but I'm no car guy and there's been a while since I tried it so I could be super off-base

Whatcha guys think?

I have 2015 Corolla and 2008 Silverado 1500 2WD. 70k miles and 198k miles. Should I sell these two to get a better truck? I kind of wanna be able to off-road and take a 4WD drive on the beach every once in a while. I also dont wanna have to worry about my 2WD slipping at the boat ramp. I have a lot of anxiety about this decision. If I sell both my cars, Id most likely still take on debt, probably around 10-20k since a new truck is higher value than the two vehicles I have for a 4WD. But the new truck would also cost 2k more in fuel economy. Am I just freaking out and should keep my current setup? Please help me based on your experiences.

Im looking to buy a new car for under 25k in Romania. 90% of the driving will be in the city. Should fit 2 adult and 1 child/baby
Must haves: good economy, isofix, android auto/CarPlay, heated seats, 5* safety rating
Nice to have: led headlights and taillights 

Currently considering a Toyota Yaris but Im concerned of it being a bit too small.

Hey guys,

So I'm coming from a Honda Civic EX 2014. And I have a lot of flexibility with my current salary. I'm really looking for something that appears intimidating/aggressive like the Honda Accord, is reliable, and high resale value, but also fun to drive.

I'm stuck on what I should buy, I just test drove the IS 350 F-sport AWD, and tbh it didn't feel much different from my Civic FWD. Maybe I need to be a car person to tell the difference, but I wasn't all that impressed.

I'm not really sure if these are really my best options. I don't know too much about cars in all honesty, I just have the resources to spend. What are your thoughts?
-------------------------------

Ive considering one of these trucks as an option and Ive always had a preference to older cars/trucks and really appreciate this body style. I know the 350 sb in these thing are quite indestructible and will last a while but Ive heard the 4l60 is kinda shit. But Ive wanted a manual for a while so what about the manual in these trucks the nv 3500 I think it is do the manuals in these things last?

Needing a larger SUV with 3 rows but enough leg room for adults in the rear. 

We went to look at the Armada and they were very happy with it. Found a few 50k-60k miles 

We couldnt find a Traverse to check the back but a lot of reviews say its a very spacious SUV for passengers. 2018 premier with 46k miles, or others ranging 10-30k miles

Or a Chevy Tahoe which I assume would have great room, and reviews (maybe biased) have said its a very reliable full size SUV. 58k miles - 70k miles

I live in a small town with parallel parking so that is a common concern.

I've been looking for a car for a few months now, this would be my first legit car and that's always an exciting prospect, I spose. I've been looking for vans for a bit because older ones usually are on the cheaper side and it'll let me lug about car parts with ease but I'm not sure where you begin even looking for that. I can spare about 2, maybe 3 grand just not anytime soon. 

Idk whats important actually, but any help would be nice!

Already planning on a suped-up Sienna but Im looking at a few electric alternatives
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-21
I've been in the market for a car for the past month or so since my 8 year old beater finally gave out on me. I had originally been for sure planning on buying used, but having dipped my toe in the market now, I feel like the used car market is even crazier than the new car market, and I don't have the liberty of time I did last time I bought a car to thoroughly inspect every used car I'm looking at.

So I'm looking to buy a new car now. My budget is about 30k, but I'd be happy with less if possible. I'm not that picky about how my car drives, mostly I just need a car that fits me (I'm 6'5), gets good gas mileage, is reliable, and is compact (street parking in a busy urban area).

I was originally looking at the new Elantra's, but I've gone to 3 dealers now and they've all tried to charge me at least 28k. Similar story with Honda Civics - most places adding dealer charges or "accessories" with at least a 5k markup over MSRP. I found this Corolla with the price locked in at 25k (about 1500 over MSRP), and just wanted to know whether this was a reasonable deal.

Hey all,

I'm no big petrolhead but I've always enjoyed the look and feel of the Alfa. I'm a fairly new and inexperienced driver currently looking to buy my first car. There are plenty of tempting offers on recent 2nd hand Giuliettas with mileage of between 8,000 and 60,000 km for about 15,000.

The safer choice for me would be a brand new VW Polo/Golf. Do you reckon I should take the risk of purchasing a used Alfa or should I wait it out until I am more experienced in owning a vehicle? What should I know before buying an Alfa (in Germany)? How reliable is it? Is it significantly more expensive to own than a VW? Bear in mind that I am fairly limited in maintenance budget as I am a student.

Hi guys, I am looking for a car that is low-key cool. Not something flashy enough to make the average person think Im a tool, but something that will make the average car guy respect me. I used to drive a 1997 4Runner (manual), and currently drive a 2014 outback (manual). Unfortunately it has to be an automatic because my fianc needs to be able to drive it too now. It can be a new car, it can be a few years old, ideally it isnt an SUV. Bonus points if its offered in a good red.

All new models, all in top or almost top trims

&amp;#x200B;

Tiguan Elegance:

\- i like the HUD

\- i like how it looks outside, i dont exactly love the inside tho

\- its 4x4, 2.0 TSI 190 hp, while 4x4 is nice i'm worried about fuel consumption

\- good driving position

\- no DCC suspension

\- okay maintenance cost and ok financing deal

&amp;#x200B;

Skoda Karoq (top trim):

\- has all Tiguan features (except HUD) + more

\- little smaller than tiguan

\- i dont love the outside looks but i think that interior looks better than Tiguan

\- 2 wheel drive, 150 hp ideal for this size

\- very good driving position

\- drives the best out of all 3

\- has DCC suspension

\- okay maintenance cost and ok financing deal

&amp;#x200B;

Sportage (top trim):

\- best interior

\- lacks some important features (no heated front windshield, only wired carplay/android auto)

\- electronic systems in reviews seem finicky

\- average driving position/visibility

\- average driving feel

\- has ECC suspension

\- Full Hybrid (not plugin) - lower gas cost

\- highest maintenance cost and worst financing deal

&amp;#x200B;

Pricewise they are all comparable 

Bottom line:

Even though Karoq is the smallest, it seems to be the reasonable choice due to the best overall features and lowest ownership costs, but still people around me think that Skoda is the budget choice and it cant escape its "budget" stigma.

I also prefer both Tiguan and Sportage outside looks where Sportage wins also on the inside but...it lacks important features and drives the worst.

Tiguan seems to be the middle ground where almost all the features are there plus HUD, i like the outside looks, interior is okay-ish but gas costs scare me a little bit.

I just cant decide... :E

All servicing have been done in an official Subaru repair shop, they have receipts. The transmission was rebuilt, engine serviced recently, brakes, suspension...but is that mileage too crazy?

I'm looking for a more affordable car to take on a long trip across Europe and then potentially sell it at the end. So reliability is a top priority.

My company will be providing me with a fleet vehicle, the amount I pay is the same for each option. I'll have a company fuel card. Business use + personal use will be approx. 12-15k mi/yr. I don't have to carry any equipment/samples for work. I've driven an SUV for the past 7 years and sedans for the 10 years prior. I do like sitting higher in an SUV, but not a requirement. Two adults in the home, no kids/pets. If I drive it for 3 years, I'll likely have a chance to buy it if I want (would need to be a good deal for me to bite).          Opinions and insights appreciated!

Vehicle options (will be 2023 models):

Volvo S60 - B5 AWD Momentum

VW Tiguan 4Motion SE

Toyota RAV4 Hybrid XLE AWD

Looking for some advice on which car would be a smarter buy. Ive been looking a at a 2011 Ford Fusion hybrid thats really clean, and has great gas mileage. The other car Im considering is a 2005 Impreza sedan, which has more miles but is cheaper and would be great for the pnw. Any advice would be much appreciated

Currently have a CX30 and it's just too small. When I bought it I didn't have my 130 LB Berner, but now that I do it's just too small to take both dogs, plus a passenger, and whatever gear we have comfortably. 

So looking for something that can handle the family comfortably but also something that's not too boring to drive. My CX30 handles nicely just doesn't have much power, but other than it's been a great vehicle.

Budget: 45k

Body Style: Sedan or SUV

Needs: Heated Seats, wheel, and mirrors, ventilated seats, apple car play

Wants: Sunroof

I've driven a CX-5 Turbo and CX-50 Turbo and really enjoyed them, they've got all the features I want. Leaning more towards the CX-50 of the two.

Also drove a Rav4 Hybrid, and it rides nice and has a bit of pep, but the interior isn't as nice as the Mazdas and I just don't like the look of them either.


Any others worth checking out? Or is the CX-5 Turbo/50 Turbo going be the best option in my price range?

Hi,

I'm in the market for a new car, and with the soaring gas prices, I am looking for a hybrid (or electric) car. I am looking for a crossover or compact SUV (the number of seats does not matter, I just prefer the feeling of driving a higher-up/bigger car). My budget is around 40k and I am looking to buy used, hopefully from 2016 onward. Ideally, I like luxury car brands, in addition to Volvos, and VW, but I am not sure if it is doable with my budget. Any recommendations?

Thanks so much!

Currently drive a 2004 Ford Explorer and like it but it has terrible AC &amp; MPG. Not worth the cost to repair &amp; pay for gas versus getting a new vehicle. Was looking at the Mazda 3 sedan and Mazda CX-30 because of the reliability, nice interior quality, and price. Interior quality is most important to me. SUV would be preferable and in the case of a Mazda, I would pay the few thousand dollar increase (about 1k) to get the SUV. The 2022 KONA is cheaper than the CX-30 but does not have as nice of an interior. Love the RAV4 and also the exterior styling of the new Explorers, but cannot afford them haha. Looking at new cars because to me, a new $20k car is better value than a $10k 2010 130k mile used car in this current market. Is hybrid/electric worth it? A RAV4 Hybrid LE is $30k, and I could probably get decent rebates from California (about 3k-10k). Although, $30k is pretty far out of my budget. I am most comfortable with $20k but would like to go lower if possible.

I loved my Mitsubishi and always thought it was incredibly reliable; however, in my area finding another Mitsubishi (or any car for that matter) in good condition is pretty hard and I thought of the import cars. Does anyone here have experience with them and if so do you recommend them?

also is it a good deal?

I personally know the owner, and he's the type of guy to treat a car like it's his baby. He bought it brand new in 2014, and he upgraded his car and he serviced it a few weeks ago. 

Car has 80k miles but I've seen some ML's lasting a long time so will this be worth it

I am in market for a car and have shortlisted 3 vehicles. I live in seattle

Currently 3 vehicles are on the market :

2014 BMW - 335i - 6 cylinder, 45 k miles, fully loaded with M sport package - $26 K, (around $29 K OTD price), 240 HP

2020 Subaru Forester premium - 6 K miles, 4 cylinder, Heated seats, apple car play, eyesight , adaptive cruise, and blind spot detection, cloth interior, smells new, 185 Hp, (OTD price $32.5 K )

2019 Outback, 250 HP(approx), 3.6 R V6 engine. 8 k miles, leather seats, harmon kardon in addition to all the features of the forester and more powerful engineer. About 5 K extra (OTD $38.5 K)

I am looking at 5-7 years timeframe. Which car to buy. I had BMW 335i previously ,loved it but it didnt do any offroading.

Budget is about 30k for crossover/compact suv.

Primarily used as the commuter. Groceries, weekend trips to mountains, parks, hardware store, etc. 10k miles/year.

I need it to fit a rear facing + forward facing carseat with a passenger in the front. I also need it to fit a stroller with all 4 passengers which ruled out most sedans.

I'd prefer AWD, something with pep, and will last 10 years without major repairs.

My top choices right now:
1. Subaru Crosstrek - Test drove and loved it. I could get a higher trim with the low msrp. My only concern is space with two car seats and any maintenance issues with Crosstreks.

2. Toyota RAV4 - I know this would be a great car in terms of reliability and all around value. I would have to settle with a low trim and I'd kick myself for not getting the hybrid. Which would probably put me over budget.

3. Ford Maverick - pretty much ruled out, but thought I'd throw it up.

Hey folks!  Ive got a dealership wanting to sell me on a Corolla Hybrid at $32795 (including some add ons like paint and interior upgrade), with that price including a $5k dealer markup.  I asked if theyd negotiate that down to closer to the $29-30k KBB fair market price for the vehicle and they flat out refused to budge on price.  I told them Id look elsewhere.

Right decision, right?  Theres no good reason to pay $5k over MSRP to a dealer who refuses to budge, even with the shortages?

Context: looking to buy a hybrid sedan (corolla, insight, acura, elantra) and make out under $30k pre-tax for sure.  Seems like a good value for money generally, and recent used car prices are so inflated it seems worth buying new for the manufacturers warranty.

I will be attending nursing school in the fall and need a reliable vehicle to get to and from clinical sites. Been reading past threads and I have a few questions about the stuff I've read concerning purchasing a vehicle that can handle the snow.

1. Does ground clearance matter for snow? Trying to decide between an SUV and sedan. Some posts mention that a sedan with good tires is fine for driving in the snow. I will be in the Cleveland area to give you an idea.

2. Is FWD+ winter tires just really as good as AWD?

3. Any suggestions for and against specific makes and models? Would like to spend $5k - $10k max if possible. I'll only be in school for 1.5 years and will sellit before I leave. So, something that won't lose its value and will sell quickly is preferred.

I'm a man from New Hampshire looking for a small, getting around car, but I don't know what to get. Mostly I'll use it for driving around town, maybe going to nearby ones. 

Here's what I want:

\-I'd like something small, because 99% of the time I'll be in it alone. I don't need or care about a back seat.

\-It needs to be easy to control. This is my first car, and I don't want to fight it to go where I want.

\-Electric would be nice for various reasons(gas is stupidly expensive, eco friendliness, etc) but I understand if gas is the best option.

\-I'd like something that can carry stuff, like maybe a pickup truck. Something I could throw a kayak or something in and head out or throw my garbage in to take it to the dump.

\-Preferably something cheap. This post is mostly to see what's out there and maybe get some leads on what to look for but if possible I'd like it to be 15k or under.

Does anyone know a car that might work for me?

It has 92k miles. One owner. Dealer wants 13.2k. I can restore the foggy Headlights myself. The driver side seat has some wear and tear. And the big one is the lower bumper cracked in half. I think 13.2k is too much. i negotiate it for 12k and the PPI turns out good, would it be worth it?

Im  looking to downsize my 2-car fleet (BMW E46 M3 &amp; Honda CR-V) to having a single car that can give me the joy &amp; utility that both cars bring me. Im kind of tired of taking care of two cars at this point.

Ideally looking for a fun-ish car thats decent on gas, living in a city. Can be manual or automatic, at this point Im indifferent to either. Hatches are cool, but so is a reliable drivetrain and power. Not opposed to vehicles a couple of years old. I used to have a BRZ, which was a great car on its own but not the best for getting around the city (too rough of a ride).

RWD is preferred, or maybe an AWD drivetrain with rear bias. Ive looked at at WRXs, I really wish they still came in a hatchback configuration. Not the biggest fan of their latest 2022 remodeling.

What other cars should I look at? Im not really interested in VW golfs/GTIs. Thanks!

First car, intent to buy it for life, which are top 3 SUVs in EVERY ASPECT (durable, aesthetics, price, reliability, mileage, fuel efficiency, etc.) in both Hybrid and Non-hybrid space?

As being noob browsed this sub and came across few mentions: 

RAV-4, cr-v, mazda cx-5 (so so), Hyundai Santa Fe

RAV 4, no where possible to get in ONTARIO, also used ones onward 2018 are just crazy hefty prices with high apr. 

Secondly, debating over hybrid vs non-hybrid, not concluding as of conflicting varied opnions. 

Please assist, thanks!

Assuming cost is relatively equivalent, which would you go with? Ive always liked VWs styling but concerned with both reliability and the turbo lag issues with the Taos. The HR-Vs 2023 redesign makes it much larger than previous years models. 

I have a deposit down for a Taos. Its being delivered to the dealership this week, but getting cold feet and thinking I should wait to get an HR-V.

Will be used for city driving.  Will be buying not leasing.

I have a 2000 Toyota avalon that my mother gave to me, so far ive fixed the rear suspension and done some oil changes. Recently it broke down and it wont start (might be the starter but pending fix right now). Everyone in my life tells me to sell it, but besides it being old, it has 134k miles on it and has no other problems otherwise. Should I sell it? Need some outside opinions. Thanks

Hi, I am a mid-20s male in Ontario, Canada looking to lease/buy (probably lease) my first car. I am about to move cities for work and will need the car primarily for the commute. My salary is in the 60-70k range. I had been considering buying used but the used car market seems pretty crazy right now (hearing stories of people selling used for more than the MSRP of a new). 

Other than commuting, I am fairly active and so I'll probably be putting my bike/snowboard into the back of the car pretty regularly (or on a roof rack if that's possible). I'll also be doing some road trips to see family and friends (\~400-1200km) about once a month. 

Currently I've been looking mostly at Kias (Selto, Rio, Forte5) and Mazdas (Mazda3 Sport, CX-3, CX-30). I would love to get something fuel efficient with gas being as expensive as it is right now. I had a 2017 Rio once previously as a work car and I liked it but I remember it being very small. Looking for any recommendations/experience/advice about these makes and models, or if there is a model I am overlooking. Cheers!

So Im currently in the process of buying a new truck, but Im torn between the F-150 and the Sierra 1500. Back in February I placed an order for an F150, but with build delays and some other concerns with issues Ive seen with the new trucks from other owners in forums, I decided to give the other brands their fair share and check them out. The Sierra 1500 elevation stood out, so I decided to place an order for that truck as well. Now Im stuck deciding between the two, both have refundable deposits so Im not tied to either on, and I really like do perspective from everyone. I really like the F150s engine and some of the standard features with the lariat, and I have owned an F150 in the past. On the other hand, the Sierras refreshed interior and multi-pro tailgate are better IMO, and Ive been with GM vehicles before. Ive listed what each truck has from an options standpoint below, some options they share so I only put some of the differences. Any opinions are greatly welcome! Thanks!

Hi, Im 16 and have been driving a 2005 Toyota highlander for about 8ish months. I think ive become a decent driver (as decent as a 16 year old can be that is) and now I have enough money to buy a nicer car. My budget is 8-12k, preferably in the 8-10k range, and honestly I really want a 350Z. I know most people dont recommend them for 16 year olds because theres a good chance Ill end up dead, so if you dont recommend it what are some cars you guys think I could be safer in but that still have a kick to them. 
Thanks for any input!

I just recently sold my 2014 MB C300 just to not have to pay for premium gas, also because I got way more than I paid for it just over a year ago now. 

I am looking into getting into a new car and was thinking of getting in line for a brand new Mazda3 Turbo for the option of regular and premium gas, and for the AWD for the harsh Canadian winters.

I was wondering if there is anything to be concerned about and to look out for with the new Mazda 2.5 turbos before commiting. I know they're still fairly new, so there may not be anything to note just yet, but just incase anyone has experience with one, and something did come up with it.

I am open to looking at other options as well.

As the title says, Lexus is moving to an Inline-4 turbo for the new RX350 as opposed to the V6, and I understand the environment benefits of it, but will it last just like the older model engines? I know toyota is a top notch company in terms of reliability but is greed one of the factors thats getting into newer cars with less reliable engines so the customer pays every couple of years?

Hey! I really need help choosing a daily driver to buy used under $25K. I want a good mix of reliable and fun which won't break the bank on maintenance.

So Im in the market for something new (to me). 

I have two cars currently. 1991 Mazda Miata that I use as my fun weekend/autocross car, and a 2014 Camry that is my daily driver. 

I love road trips and take them frequently. However the Miata isnt always enjoyable for long distances (Ive done a couple 1000 mile trips in it, and it was rough ) and although my Camry is great for road trips I want something that might be better for doing some light off-road stuff to camping spots etc. 

Im a 23 year old guy 
Have about 25k to spend comfortably 
Looking for something thats not too bad to insure, and manual transmission, also something that wont leave me stranded. Im pretty good with a wrench and have always done my own maintenance/repairs so Im not worried about cars that may require a little more love than usual just nothing thatll randomly leave me stranded. 

My current thoughts are maybe a golf all track or some Subaru. 

Thanks in advance!

Basically the title, the dealer originally wanted over $30k OTD, I said $27k at 3%, they said they couldn't do it. I pretty much walked out while the sales guy was still trying to sell me, he also said he couldn't take any money off because they had no new Corollas on the lot and somebody would buy it at $30k.

Then hours later I got a call that they could do $27k at 3%, I went back to sign the paperwork and they said they it had to be at 6% because I was a first time buyer, I said it had to be 3% and they eventually said they could do that rate for 64 months which I've never heard of before.

Anyway I checked around, Honda is up charging more and no other dealers could do less than 6% anyway.

So is $27k at 3% good for a new Corolla LE?

Also worth mentioning I'm buying new because I met with a credit union and they recommended I get a large car loan so I can get the home loan I want in the future, thanks.

If I sell the Ram, I could have $23,000 cash to purchase another vehicle. I would want a pickup that is reliable and safe. Something of the same size 1500-2500 with 4wd, and a 8 cylinder engine.

I'm currently looking for a new (to me) vehicle under the 40k mark. I am primarily interested in hatchback/sportbacks that are fun to drive, decently reliable and have some nice convenience features. I'm in a decently snowy state so AWD is nice even though I'm aware it's not absolutely required. I would prefer to buy new considering most used are selling near new MSRP. Used is not out of the question as long as it's decently reliable. 

What I've looked at so far: 

Mazda 3 - literally not a single (new) one for sale within 150 miles of me. The few dealers I spoke to said they are not making anymore this year to focus manufacturing on the SUVs. The few used ones are kinda high mileage while being listed for the same as a brand new unit. 

GTI - Also very interested in these but markups are insane around me. Even a new S trim is approaching 40k. Also new touch controls seem to be a big negative. Can anyone speak on these? 

Stinger - Absolutely love this car, but anything with AWD is typically out of my range unless it has high mileage. 

Civic - Love the looks but everything felt so muted in the car during a test drive. Also wtf is up with the markups on these? 

Integra - I placed a preorder on one of these but after watching many first impressions I cancelled as I think I'd have the same thoughts about this as the civic. 

My price is a bit flexible but I'm comfortable with the above. Any other recommendations? If not, any thoughts on the above? 

Thanks for reading and I hope you have a nice day!

I currently have a 2017 KIA Sportage (AWD).  Bought it used two years ago and it has been a decent ride.  It just reached the end of its 5 year warranty.  Is there much to be gained in terms of safety by trading in the Sportage now for something else?  I know it's a very open question so here are some priorities to help narrow it down:

* AWD preferred because we are in Northeast USA in a very hilly neighborhood
* Total budget (after trade-in) is around 35k.  Open to new or used, though I usually go for used 2 year old models that are just past the steepest part of depreciation.  (Is that even a smart strategy? Open to advice...)
* Obviously we'd like something with top crash test safety ratings, but I was also wondering how to weigh in things like handling, safety features, and rollover risk.  This will be our only vehicle and my wife will be using it a lot as a new driver
* *Would be nice* to get better mpg than our Sportage has (21 city / 25 highway).  Hybrid would also be nice but not sure how to weigh that benefit against reliability risks.

With those things in mind, I am completely open to recommendations - crossovers, wagons, sedans.  I've been going in circles a bit researching the newer hybrid Toyota Sienna, the cheapest Chrysler Pacifica with AWD, and used Volvo wagons within my price range.  Any other ideas?  Or maybe the Sportage is about as safe as it gets within my budget and reliability concerns?  TIA

so I don't really NEED a new car but have been exploring the idea of getting a new one. Recently got a 22 corolla for MSRP, and I've already been offered 1k-2k more than what I paid for it, so getting rid of it shouldn't be an issue. Reasons why I want to upgrade:

1 - It's kinda loud on the highway

2. Audio system is okay but would prefer better

3. It's a sedan, I'd prefer a hatchback.

4. Cloth seats, would like leatherette/leather

Been looking at a mazda3 hatch, civic hatch, and lately the new integra (base model). Does it make sense to upgrade giving my reasons or would I just be wasting money? I found a dealer selling a base integra for MSRP, so I've been thinking about it. I work remotely so the car would probably get 7k-10k miles a year. Mostly just errands / weekends / road trips.

Any other vehicle I overlooked for my needs ? Just looking for relatively comfortable/quiet, decent audio system, hatchback (highly prefer, but not a deal breaker). I make around 85K, so was hoping to stay under 35K (the less the better lol). Have a SO but no kids or pets. Thanks

2021 Porsche Taycan RWD (base) - $98,875, 11k miles. Options - Premium package, panoramic sunroof, ventilated seats, upgraded wheels. 

If I were to order a one new from Porsche would take about 9 months and costs about 5k more. This one still has Porsche manufacturers warranty, clean carfax and 1 previous owner. Buying from non-Porsche car dealership. Doesn't seem like a bad deal. Thoughts?

I've been toying with the idea of getting a Tour X since it ticks a couple of boxes in my lifestyle and I was curious on what some long term ownership opinions were on the car. What bothers you? How have you fixed it? What are some nifty kinds of upgrades you can get by borrowing factory parts from other models? 

The lack of flappy-paddles is kind of lame (I love playing the driving video game) but I suspect there's a way to get it working with another GM steering wheel. Has anyone tried this?

From what I've been reading, i see a lot of potential as a hot wagon. A variant of the engine was good for 275hp in the turbo 4 Camaro so there's a good chance that the Tour X has some tuning potential (possibly an easy 300hp?) with some dealer parts and software. The transmission seems like it could be a weak point though. What kinds of suspension upgrades exist for this car?

There seems to be a lot of things that can be done to enhance the look of the Tour X too, like de-cladding, and more attractive bumpers from the Opel Insignia (and even a wing of some kind?) What have you done to your car?

Hi everyone,

I'm looking to buy a used car that'll (hopefully) last me 10+ years. I mainly use my car for commuting to work daily (only 10 min away) and occasional road trips (maybe twice a year) from SoCal to NorCal. 

I found a near perfect condition '95 Integra SE with 115k miles and I was just wondering if this car would fit my use case if maintained well. I understand that there are better used cars out there for my situation, but I really like the look of the Integra and I feel like I could really take care of it if purchased.

I've been toying with the idea of buying a Tesla for a few years now, but they're everywhere and I dislike Elon Musk, so I'd rather put my money into something different. I'm open to an EV, but the primary thing I want is a car that can nearly self-drive.  I sit in traffic for 2 hours a day, and need something that has Adaptive Cruise Control that works in the 5-10mph range and can handle light curves.  I don't need to it completely pilot me from point A to point B.

I wanted to get  a full electric car (200+ mile range) but it seems like all the dealers either are selling ridiculously high ($55k-$60k) or they sell Mach-E or Teslas (Carmax).  My budget is around $40-$45k before the incentive.  I currently have a leased Bolt EV, which is great but it's going to expire next year, so I definitely need to get another car pretty soon.  

The RYR funds expire in early September (3 months to use it).  It seems like the only car I could find that fits is the Hyundai Kona EV or maybe the Hyundai Ioniq 5 (if I can get the base model).  I don't see anything for the VW (ID.4) or Kia EV6 available from list of available dealers.

Bought a 2007 ES350 in 2019 for 8k, and it keeps overheating. The cost of repairs are just not worth it. 
I need a car that can drive me a half-hour to work without issues and this ain't it.
What reliable car should I look into? Looking into Toyota sedans, possibly?

Hi!

I currently drive a 2012 Toyota Yaris sedan. On a bad day, with a deflating tire, Im able to get 33 mpg. At best, Ive been able to get 38 mpg. The average tends to be 34 and 35 mpg. Its range is usually 360 miles. 

Fuel efficiency is absolutely the most important thing to me in a car because I need the car to drive, I love driving far distances, and Im cheap (dont like refueling often, etc.). My friend has a 2019 Kia Forte, and I think it gets 31 mpg city and 41 mpg highway. Thats better by a few miles, but it doesnt feel like a big change from my current car. I want to consider an upgrade soon, but the one thing I *need* is drastically better fuel efficiency than what I have.

Ive had my eyes set on the Kia Niro and its high fuel efficiency. These are some other notes if itd help give me suggestions:
- Im pretty partial to Toyotaand Kia a little bit. Longevity is big for me.
- Ive never had an electric or hybrid car, but when I was shopping for a prius, I learned how expensive those batteries can be. This is my fear with the Niro, in addition to me being unfamiliar to its mechanics.
- I also have a really good and cheap Toyota mechanic.
- Ive installed my own radio with Apple CarPlay, so although Im a fan and want that, I can always add it myself.

One thing Im looking for that Im bad at searching for:
- My friend has a Honda Civic, and I really, really like its feature to turn on from a distance and get the AC/heat ready before I get in.

I trust the civic, but itd feel like Im getting a car just for that feature since the mpg is comparable to my own. 

Short version:
Automatic start-up like the civic, trailblazing for mpg like the niro, but nothing unreliable like nissan, ford, etc.

Thanks :)

Hi everyone; I've posted here before but I'm a bit conflicted. I'm looking for a small/mid-size sedan with less than like 85k miles, AWD for winter, 250 or more hp, and good reliability. I'm looking to spend about 20K or less and want like a 2014 or above. I like bluetooth, heated seats, back-up camera, if so carplay. I've looked at certain brands and I don't want like foreign cars like Audi, Mercedes, BMW, because they can be expensive with parts and reliability. I also shy away from Ford, chevy, gmc, and lincoln (bro has this one).

So some background. This will be a car for my wife, we already own a 21 Camry hybrid. Currently we live in an apartment but landlord is allowing us to install a level 2 charger if we go that route. 

The car will be used mainly for around town, with an average of 30-40 miles a day. 60/40 highway-city driving. 

The two cars we are looking at are:
2022 Hyundai Elantra hybrid limited: $30,030

2022 Chevy bolt 2lt: $30,500

What would you all do? The savings in gas right now is very tempting to eat the 1,000 ish dollar cost of getting a level 2 charger at home. 

Located in southern Ohio, chargers seem to be decent around our area so not sure. 

Would appreciate any and all opinions. Other options, etc.

Someone I know personally offered me their Chevy Suburban w 180k miles on it. Has the 350 in it and says its in good shape mechanically.

Would you buy? My main concern is finding a car I can drive for the next 1-2 years while truck prices (hopefully) come down. Money is very much a concern. Im currently out of a vehicle and borrowing one from family

Note: I have the ability to work from home and carpool for my 20 mile commute.

Hey y'all, 

been driving a toyota yaris 2010 for the past 7 years, want to get a new car. I do have a few questions that I hope some of you can answer.

1) First of all - is now a good time to buy a used car, or are prices still mega inflated because of supply-chain delays?

2) Second, what is the best route to buy a car for someone who doesn't know much about them. Do I go private, or from a dealership?

3) My budget is 20k. If I am buying used, what APR% financing should I be looking for? What is too high? If a dealership offers 7% financing, but my bank offers less, shouldn't I just take a loan with my bank and use that?

4) What / how do I negotiate a car price when at the dealership?

Sorry for all the questions; thanks in advance!

Hi all, I am considering to buy this car because it has more space than my current toyota auris wagon, but still a hybrid which gives me tax cuts in NL. I have 2 kids and after selling my MX5 I gave up having fun in any other cars. So a boring mama-tank is fine.
I read bad news about the battery loosing capacity quite fast. Should I change my mind? Thanks!

Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot or Hyundai Palisade? Leaning Asian brands for the long term benefits, and a larger cargo space might be necessary for me.

Hi all! Im on my third Subaru Outback (Ive always leased) but the lease was up in May. Because the dealership had zero inventory to swap me into a 2022 version, Im not just going month to month waiting to even hear about 2023 pricing let alone when inventory will be in. The buy out price is very good and it has very low mileage, so I considered just buying it, but I dont love this trim and wanted to upgrade so

Now Im looking for an alternative and hoping that another manufacturer might have inventory now or sooner than Subaru will. I love a station wagon! Any suggestions?? And are all manufacturers in this same boat?? TIA!

Ive been looking at cars and came across two used hybrid cars (2007 civic and 2007 Prius) and both owners are asking at least $2000-$3000 above KBB average valuation of their cars, with non-negotiable prices. Is that common given the current market/gas prices?

Coz otherwise Ive seen KBB being pretty reflective of the car prices I see (or at least the owners negotiate down to those prices).

Hey guys, looking at purchasing a used car for my mum. Currently looking at Yaris in the $7-9k range, and some Corollas in the $14-16k range (we are located in Western Australia). She mainly needs a reliable car for commuting to work, and doesnt require much. Do you guys think its worth going up in price to the Corolla for the nicer interior, reverse camera, drivertrain and nicer package overall. She will be keeping this car for the vast foreseeable future. Or for what she needs are the added features  not worth the extra cost? Any feedback appreciated. Have a good one

Asking from down under where these two are similar priced gibr or taken 10k AUD.

Love the look of CLA more and hence leaning towards it but feel like it wont age (and depreciation as well) as well as the M440i.

Cureently drive a 2016 C200 and drove a 2008 BMW 3 series previously.

Would like the input from current owners of the two as well!

Thanks guys!

So Im (18M) going to back to college in the fall and my parents are giving me a car. My budget is 40k, but I was given two options:
1) Get a 40k car
2) get a car thats under 40k and I get the rest of the money(so for example if I get a car thats only 20k I get the rest of the 20k)

Should I go for a 40k car to experience it or should I opt for a cheaper one and invest the rest? 
I am still a student with little to no expensive with a part time job.
Also please give me some car recommendations for either choice, thanks

I know the market is terrible but I can't get over the fact that I would be paying almost 8 grand for a 23 year old car. Despite that, it's still the lowest price I've seen on one with that low of miles after 6 months of searching. What do you think?

Hey, I want to get a cheap used manual car which I can hopefully do some small mods to. I have a few cars I am choosing between and I want the car to be well below 10k. I would prefer if its rear wheel drive but its not a deal breaker. 
These are a few of the cars near me that I can do some basic stuff on cars like oil change and stuff and at the moment I dont have many tools but anyway, here are the cars I am looking at:

2004 base mustang:

I have always had small cars. I had a 2004 Mini Cooper and followed that with a 2015 Chevy Spark. I like my little spark, however, some life changes are pushing me for an upgrade. 

* I live in rural Ohio, and the spark can get stuck in just a few inches of snow. 
* Even though I am now a hybrid worker, on the days I do have to go into the office, my commute is longer.
* My parents moved to the mountains of North Carolina, and I would love to be able to visit. My little car can barely make it up these small Ohio hills. 
* My dogs have outgrown the back seat. 

Things I want in a new car

* AWD
* The ability to get up a mountain
* Safety features like lane departure, parking assist, and blind-spot alerts. 
* a bit bigger of a back seat. 
* Cloth interior
* On the smaller side of things

I'd like to keep the cost down as much as possible, but I realize that everything is more expensive. I would love to keep it as close to 25k or lower as possible, but I don't even know if that is possible.

So Would you guys pay 3500$ for a g6 with 225,000 miles on it.  Things it also needs oil change, new cv axel and the car shakes when pressing the brakes when coming off the highway.  Car also has dents in driver door and on the front of the car.  Just wondering because Ive been driving it for a couple weeks now and Im suppose to make payments on it to an acquaintance but I feel like its not worth it at this point.

hi guys,

do you think i should trade in my 2020 tacoma for a 2022 crosstrek? i love how my tacoma looks, i think its awesome but i think i need more space inside. there are certain things i dont want to store in the bed even with a cover and then i have to store in the back seat which takes up seating space. so i was looking into the 4runner but prices are ridiculous so i started looking at crosstreks. 

i got an offer for pretty much what i paid for my tacoma and could get a new crosstrek limited for about 7k less. 

wish i could keep both but its not an option. 

has anyone sold their tacoma and regretted it? any advice? thanks

Went to a dealership and bought a new 2021 Honda Civic EX for 31k. Interest was 2.9. My monthly is 560 for 5 yrs with 10k down. I know the base price was above market but I loved the look and model of it so much. After the dust has settled im feeling regretful of what ive done. Does anyone have any advice or input they could chime in for me? Thanks.

Hi! I recently graduated college and got a job as a swe (23 y/o) making about 160k a year. I've been in love with the supra since I was a little kid, but also interested in the new gr86 for a bit of time. I'm a bit worried being a slave of my car, but also want to really enjoy sports cars while I'm young. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to finance a supra out or maybe financing a gr86 and then trading it in for a supra later on. 

It also seems that insurance will be about 3-4k a year since i'm under 25 for both the supra &amp; gr86 so thats something to consider

thanks!!!

Hello, I know the used car market is insane right now, but I just graduated and need to get a car to move to a different state and commute to work (approx. 2hrs everyday roundtrip).

All I really care about is that the car is reliable (not breaking down or constantly needing repairs), safety ratings, fuel efficient, and pretty much only the basics.

I am currently looking at Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan cars as most people tell me those are reliable. I am open to Sedans and SUVs. I really want to get a car under 10,000 USD but if nothing seems right/available I will go for under 15,000 USD.

I've checked Carmax, Carvana, FB, local dealershops. It seems like Carmax and Carvana has way higher prices, around 3-5k more compared to KBB, FB is usually under or equivalent to KBB and local delershops are around 1K above KBB.

1. Are there any more car makes I should look into?
2. What make and model should I focus on (I do know Civics and Corollas are very reliable but none seem to be available atm)?
3. Should I just buy a car from Carmax/Carvana even with the high prices?

I know the basics of cars as i know the mechanics of it and studied it during college, but its all from books and not from actual driving experience or working with cars XD (I know that I should check for fluid leakage engine/undercarriage, rust, past accident history), but never really had my own car to drive so very inexperienced and don't know much about what is considered a red flag so any tips will be helpful

1. How does the normal dealership process look like (insurance, titles, test drive, taking it to a mechanic for a double check &lt;--- I have no clue how to handle these)
2. How do you know if a dealer is trying to F you over?
3. Should I avoid FB entirely (not very confident that Id be able to )?

Thank you so much!

Hi all,

I am a new member of this community and was hoping to get some advice from car experts like you all. I am a college student and am looking to purchase my first vehicle. I am currently very interested in buying a mustang(2005 and on). I have found a few used ones from private parties and some from dealers that seemed interesting to me. I know that because of gas prices used and new vehicle prices have gone up considerably. Roughly how much should I be paying for a 2005 and up Mustang with around 100,000 miles on it? I know that there is no exact number that I should be paying but I just want to know in what range should I be paying?

Previous owner of an r55 mini cooper s clubman, current owner of an na miata as my daily. I live where we get a good bit of snow and I dont want to attempt driving it in the winter, but that isnt my only priority, id like more than two seats. Preferably nothing too big, just something fun weird and practical that can still turn heads. Cars that have been catching my eye have been the Volvo c30, lexus ls400, rx8, or something along those lines. Im into weird old luxury sedans as well. Thanks!

What kind of cars and price ranges would you look at?

a. finance a 2022 car
b. buy a used car with 110~150k miles from a private seller for &lt;$7k
c. any suggestions?

Im worried that option b would come with high maintenance costs. One person was selling a 2009 Honda Civic with 146k miles for $6.5k and their recent maintenance fees in the last year added up to ~$2,900. Is this what I should expect to spend every year for cars this old?

Im in North Dakota and the winters here are brutal. I need a car and I dont want to get a Corolla and be like, Shit. I cant go anywhere cause my car wont move. 

Which poses the question, could I get a front wheel drive car like a Corolla and just put some snow tires on it and get around fine? Or do I need an Outback or RAV4 to suffice in snowy conditions?

Thanks everyone!

Ill be graduating college in may 2023 and will be looking at cars shortly after and would prefer something practical that I would have for the next 5 or so years and would be doing mods to like a cold air intake, new wheels and suspension, and an exhaust. What cars should I be doing my research on that would respond well (not sound like a lawnmower) to these mods but still be practical for a daily driver? All feedback is appreciated!

Hello. I am currently searching for my next car, and I have a specific checklist of features that I am looking for:
- Full or mid size 4 door sedan
- decent/good MPG
- boxy shape (think Chrysler 300, Cadillac DeVille, Toyota Century)
- Reliable car (will reach 250k miles if treated right) 
- below $10,000 on the used market with 100,000 miles or less
- model year 1995 or later 
- safe car (doesn't have to be the safest car on the road, but definitely not something that will put me in more danger than the average 1995+ car would)

I thought I would ask this subreddit: do you have any recommendations for car models that would fit this description? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this.

Hi everyone,

I have been driving a used 2014 Subaru Crosstrek (XV) for less than 6 months and I'm already sick of CVT behaviour and the car's gutless engine. I am looking to sell it soon and get finance for a new car. Mazda CX-30 seems like a great option to me because I like Mazdas, the engine is powerful enough, there is a premium finish to the interior, and it's not too big/too small. I know about the lack of space for the second-row passengers, but I'm ok with it because I'm single. I am looking at the top specs (Astina) because Bose sound system is only available on Astina and it is really important to me to have great-sounding audio in my car (this was the first upgrade I did to the Crosstrek). I'd prefer to have AWD as I'm in Australia and I'm going off-road once a month or so (and the difference in price for AWD vs FWD CX-30 is insignificant).

I am just curious whether you think there are better options out there and a better bang for buck? I am looking for a small SUV with zippy engine, comfortable ride, good audio, and ideally all the modern safety/vision options. It should not be a turbo because of the current high petrol prices. 

CX-30 Astina AWD here is priced \~$50k AUD (\~$35k USD) and I'm just wondering if I'm blinded by my wants and do not see a better option. E.g. RAV4 is too big, Hyundai is less refined and not zippy enough, Kia has a dual-clutch transmission in their SUVs, Honda is pricey and not as good, German cars are expensive to buy and maintain, what else? A hybrid would be ideal but I don't think I'll find anything nice and fun to drive to this kind of price, and hybrids are usually not AWD.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-19
Looking to buy a car for when I graduate college and get a full time job. I like the way the Kia souls look but I have no idea if they are actually good vehicles. If I can afford it Id like to buy the car brand new or at least only a few years old. In a car I just hope to find something reliable that will require low maintenance and will feel safe and Ill be able to keep it long term. But I enjoy that the soul comes in a bunch of fun colors and looks a bit more unique compared to other cars out there.

Im in the market for a new family suv and cant decide between these 3 suvs. I know the 2023 crv has not been released yet but Im willing to wait and see what Honda has to offer. Looking for feedback from owners or people who have cross shopped these cars recently to weigh pros and cons. Many thanks!

Hello Folks, intending to buy my first SUV car the Toyota RAV4 XLE Hybrid by being totally noob. Yesterday called 3 dealers in Toronto, and came to know there's no way I can get 2022 one instead downtown suggested to book now for 2023, also conflicting and shady communications not fair answer. having said that they selling previous years models at hefty price like $45-50K+tax. Moreover since than I figured out through autotrader, canadadrives, kijiji, fb that used car market is just crazy. Unimaginable prices. I thought we were only dealing with real estate market, didn't knew auto market was in same squad. Anyways, I'm confused as being noob and first car, I need it at immediate as of family needs. Following are few options with some queries, would appreciate if you enlighten and advice me: 

- Any other alternate to RAV4 in Hybrid space SUV, I should look into? But I guess same sentiment across all brands. 
- should I look out outside Toronto? 
- Should I book for 2023 and get in the meanwhile some $3-4K used car, once SUV arrives I sell used one back at less. 
- can I even get 2020ish model at reasonable price somewhere? I'm relying on authorized dealers as of assurance and financing, hence not private owners.

I currently drive a 2018 Civic with 27k miles. I've had it for 4 years. I leased it for 2 years and then bought into it. I have 12k left on the car note and the note is 273 a month (through credit union). Its a solid car. I had to replace the battery but besides that, its been running fine. But I feel like its time for an upgrade

I am getting a promotion soon and I have been eyeing a 3-series (330i specifically) BMW. I'm not that knowledgeable in cars. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Buy new? Used? Wait it out? What is the best way I should approach this, considering the market and everything

So currently I have a 2015 Dodge Dart with about 100k miles.. I want to buy a used classic car because I really like the looks but am pretty sure its not the best Idea in terms of maintenance and gas. I am definitely on a strict budget and need to make sure the car gets me through college and the 10 hour drive from Illinois to Atlanta georgia twice a year. Would this be a good buy given the low gas mileage? Or should I still keep the dart?

We are both in our younger 20s. My bf needs a car, but we are not buying one yet. I would like to see what people can recommend. My bf's family has 3 cars that have not been properly maintained by his father. Two vehicles have their engine lights on, and we don't know when their last scheduled maintenance was. The third one is illegal, no safety check or registration.

My other half is 6'5 so I think it's best we either get him an SUV or truck. I currently drive a Subaru Forester so we already have an SUV. He wants a truck but we're both aware that we don't need one. Neither of us have jobs that will utilize the truck bed/storage. However we both like to go out on outdoor adventures. My subaru is our current adventure vehicle. We really want a 4x4. I will admit we don't go out too often nowadays because we don't have  the time. We've looked at dealers online and so many 4x4 trucks, whether mid sized or full sized, are high 40k-50ks. I can say the same for 4x4 SUVs. Not that we can't afford it together, it's just too much money for our age. We are open to buying used and would appreciate any recommendations. I do want to say that we come from an area with **A LOT** of Toyota Tacoma's/4runners so we would like to stray away from those two models.

Thank you.

I have to drive a couple miles on the highway each day for work. I know they arent self driving, but which vehicles make highway driving the easiest? Are all adaptive cruise controls built the same, or is one king of them all?

Im not considering Tesla as I cant charge at home or work. I also have a budget of 25k and looking for a 2019 sedan or newer. Would be nice to have something fun to drive as well. Right now considering 2019 Mazda 3.

Hey guys, I just joined my first job and need to buy a car. I can put up to 35k$ but need your help to suggest me a good car preferably a used one.
-------------------------------

Hi - should I buy either of these cars? I currently don't have a car. $13k is kind of my top budget, but this Spark EV seems like it could be a real boon. It also has DC Fast Charge. I live in Socal and don't really travel very far from my apartment and when I had a car, I barely drove it. I have a very tiny and hard to reach parking spot, otherwise I have to park on the street.  

Car | Price | Miles
---|---|----
2016 Chevy Spark EV | $14,600 | 46k miles
2006 BMW 325i | $6,000 | 132k miles

I am pretty desperate for something. I haven't have a car in 4 years and I feel like my life is suffering for it.
-------------------------------

I have. JKU 2014   I have replaced the shocks and had some minor work done to keep it stock but it is no good when I want to drive a few hours to go fish. 

I have a 2018 sequoia and its like driving a comfy couch and my wife insists that I use that since it can haul all my unnecessary fishing gear up into the mountains. 

Ive gone a few times now and it seems good except for a few times Ive been on logging roads where I feel like Im going to break it when I need to use 4wd. I am not off-roading but occasionally the road gets sketching and rutty and I dont want to get stuck. My stock JKU with KO2 handles this stuff just fine but the sequoia is stocking with Michelini defenders. And I worry something is going to break on the sequoia.  

So for the past few years Ive been looking at 4Runners. Ive looked at FJs too. My wife loves how the FJs look but they have little storage and poor visibility and Im never going to intentional off-road them. 

Basically I just wish my Jeep were more comfortable on the drive there and back but it perfects for mountain roads I tend to drive. 

Any alternatives?

I'm buying my first car and I'm going to be getting my license in a couple of weeks. 

Options I'm looking at 
1) Toyota Camry
2) Honda Accord

Black exteriors and interiors 
75-85k upper limit of miles 
2017-2022 years 

Trying to get it for something close to 22k 
 
I can put down close to 20-25% down payment 

So that my insurance and monthly payment stay close to 450 or less 

I'm thinking of financing it through my local credit union cause I do not want to pay out of my savings and I'm a recent credit card holder cause I'm an immigrant in the states. 

Please let me know if I should look for something else in terms of price, models or other car makes. 


Thank you

Bought a used 2012 Ford Fiesta in 2015 and it recently (pretty much) died. With less than 147k miles on it, and despite regular maintenance. I don't want to call it a lemon, but it has had its fair share of issues. The check engine light was a constant source of stress. It has had multiple types of overheating problems. The latest overheating issue has rendered it undriveable, though the engine does still run. 

I don't think I want to sink even more money into it, but I'd like opinions as to whether it'd be better to just repair it (it will have to be towed, another expense) or sell it for whatever pittance they'll give me and move the hell on. I want to note that even if it's repaired and the overheating issue is resolved, the check engine issue will still be there, as it's definitely unrelated. There are times the check engine light will turn off for a few weeks, but then it eventually pops back on. Trying to get it to pass inspection has been a challenge.

Budget: Under $18k with TTL, shipping, etc. Would prefer under $15k, though.

Needs: Primarily a commuter car. Fairly fuel efficient. Fairly low maintenance. Nothing fancy. Hatchback, wagon, or small SUV is a plus because I sometimes take my dogs to the park, beach, etc., or need to transport stuff to/from a classroom at beginnings/endings of semesters. Definitely no 2-door vehicles.

I'd love to have something that has a back-up camera and bluetooth, so I've mostly been looking at stuff from about 2016 and on. However, it's slim pickings. Obviously I know Honda and Toyota are among the most reliable, but they're also in fairly high demand and are thus higher-priced. 2016 Corollas, for example, are about $16-17k before TTL, and that's with about 100k miles.

I've been looking most at Hyundai Elantras, Chevy Sparks, and Honda Fits. I know the Spark is not the best car, but it's obviously the most budget-friendly, and I can get a more recent model with lower mileage compared to the other two. Should I steer clear? I admittedly worry it'll be a repeat of the Fiesta. What other vehicles should I consider? What about the Mazda 3? I also see a bunch of Fiestas within budget, but I don't know if I just got unlucky or if they're actually crappy.

Or should I just face the fact that I'm going to have to spend a lot more money on my current car?

If you have a recent (2016 to 2022) Toyota Rav4 and you live in the city, what roughly has been your experience? I live on the outer edges of a city and sometimes like to drive into/through the city (Boston) to see my friends or go places, including maybe the occasional parallel park. I also have had slightly tight parking spots where I live. I had an 05 rav4 which was tiny length and width-wise. Now Rav4s are bigger so I've been apprehensive about switching to a bigger vehicle, but I see they're actually a couple inches shorter than a Toyota corolla! 181". They are about 3 inches wider, though, at 73"... Overall they're small to average and just look more bulky than they are. I have test driven many subcompact SUVs and none have felt/overall were as good as the new Rav4. Have you had issues living or visiting the city with the Rav4? Do you actually live in a city area with a Rav4 and what do you think? Thanks!

Does anyone know cars that can be bought used for up to like 12k CAD? Looking for a four seater with a fair-sized trunk. I have been looking at Honda Civics but don't know what year is best bang for buck. Thanks alot :) Also idk about mileage so if someone can give me tips on what the max I should buy is  would be greatly appreciated.

I'm carless. I'm leaning towards a Subaru Impreza wagon. They'll have 2023 ones out in the fall. Right now, I can pay new prices for 2019 models with 10-30K miles. 

I'm wondering if there's some smart way to pay around $10K for something that'll likely still be worth $8-10K as a trade-in once the new Imprezas come in (whether that's August or December). Is that a good or bad idea? And what cars (make / model / year / miles) would you recommend I target? (I think 5000 miles is more likely than 10000 for the half year I'd plan to own this car)

Thoughts? Is this a money-losing plan / should I just accept the reality of the market and pay inflated rates for the 2019 Impreza and accept that I'm just paying $4-6000 more than I'd pay in a normal market?
-------------------------------

I actually made a post here a couple days ago of the 3 Lexuss I was looking at, received a lot of feedback and help. But Im covering all bases being its my first car ever, so I know Mercedes isnt known for reliability. But which models and years would you recommend if I were to look? Sedan and SUV. But Id lean towards more a sedan for my first car.

I know fun &amp; cheap dont really overlap in the current market, but Im looking for the best of both worlds.
Ive got a 2022 Gr86, but getting ready to drive around 150 miles a day for work and school and Im not looking to put those miles on my 86.
Ive got around 5k cash to spend on a beater. I can do simple maintenance and work on my car, but Im more a credit card mechanic. Manual would be a big plus, but I can forgo it.
Currently considering a NA or NB Miata, Civic, 05-09 Mustang and Chevy Cobalt SS. Open to anything else though.

Just looking for something reliable with more cargo room than your typical sedan but not as big as an SUV or van.  It will be used for commuting to work and various hobbies in the city (occasionally on the freeway) and picking up things from home depot for home improvement.  I understand there are things like drywall and wood that I'll probably just rent a truck for.  Also really want a backup camera.

My friends were rear ended by a distracted driver and in my opinion, the only reason why things weren't catastrophic for my friends is because my friends were in a ~3700 lb vehicle built in 2018, compared to the other guy who was in a ~2600 lb 2010 Fit.  That's why there's the weight requirement.

I can see some 2013 Toyota Venza for about $21k with 60k miles, but I'm hoping for something smaller.

Thank you in advance.

So for a little bit of a backstory I've been looking at buying a car from a somewhat shady used car dealer that has good reviews and I'm really nervous about contacting them because I've never done this before. Does anyone have any advice on what I should text or ask them?

Top priorities are:
1. Personality/fun factor on the road
2. Good inputs (steering, throttle, manual)
3. Sounding good and looking good

I'd love suggestions and opinions from people with real world experience. I know there will be tradeoffs, since there's nothing at this price that can do it all. Currently my list of cars to try to test drive includes the GR86, Miata, Honda S2000, Mazda RX8, Nissan 300ZX, Camaro, and Mustang GT. Open to pretty much any suggestions, since frankly I don't really know what I'll like best given my limited experience.

I've been in the market for a new car for about a year now.
I need to upgrade from the 86 volvo beater I've been driving around, and would like to purchase a midsized "suv" for daily driving, and the ocasional "softroading" and car camping with my two dogs.
I'm avoiding a full size SUV like the 4 runner(dreamcar), or a truck, due to the current Gas prices.

I've been eyeing the forester, but there is so much mixed information I'm hesitant to pull the trigger on anything.

I live in the pnw, need awd to handle the ocasional snow/ice, and vague reliability and longevity over anything.

I'm not a "car guy" though I woukd like to learn, and I don't mind doing basic maintenence and repairs. 
I've done alternator swaps a few times, and can follow youtube videos pretty well on sml jobs. I just don't want something that's gonna be an ongoing project.

My price range s ideally 12k-14k without breaking the bank. Most foresters I can afford are 2011-2014 Era.
I've also been considering a lifted 2005 Honda crv with 87k miles on it for 11k. 

Any alternative suggestions? What kind of service records should I be looking for based on milage?

I've been researching almost nonstop and my brain is starting to hurt from information overload. Any help from an experienced car person would be greatly appreciated.

Ive been shopping causally for a vehicle since December, and now my car is finally starting to give out completely. My budget is under 30k (if it was 3 years ago I would have been more than happy with 15k, but it seems that doesnt give you much of a vehicle anymore). 

Everything that seems to fit my needs is either on back order for months or ridiculously overpriced used. Im hoping to get input based on my previous vehicles and the likes/dislikes about them. 

1997 Jeep Grand Cheroke
First car, absolutely loved it even if I only had 5 months with it. Loved the ride height, the ability to fix everything, and the fact that I knew I could drive anywhere with it. 

2002 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer
I hated the gas mileage this thing had, but the leather trim was amazing, I loved the smooth ride and excess power it had for my needs. Wish it had been more reliable but only a handful of things went wrong in the few years I owned it before the transition went out. 

2002 Ford Taurus
Didnt like this car at all, the only thing I did like about it was that it had been my grandmothers. Was slow, broke all the time, seats were somewhat comfortable due to the size but the material was awful on hot days. 

2003 Honda Accord v6
Didnt like or dislike much about this car. Leather and the v6 was nice but I was a bit cramped, back would start to hurt after an hour or two. 

2001 Lexus LX470
Loved this beast of a thing despite all its quirks (no radio, hydraulic suspension was held up by zip ties). Never got stuck anywhere (bad winters here), was able to haul whatever I needed it to, ample space and power, and ridiculously reliable. Only true downside was the mpg. 

2007 Volvo XC70 (5 cylinder turbo)
Current car and I love it, minus the fact it has 240k miles and has just about everything going out in it. Fun to drive, able to carry my dog and I plus all my tools. I would buy another but theyre selling for twice as much as I would be comfortable spending on it; its hard to justify 15/20k for such an outdated and high mileage car. 

At this point Ive given up putting requirements because I know theres no way I wont have to compromise. If it can fit me and my golden retriever and doesnt make you snore behind the wheel Ill be happy, if it can tow 3k lbs and will be able to carry some tools/materials Ill be ecstatic.

Hey all, 

I had posted a few days ago to look at a few options for a work commuter to rack up tons of miles to keep miles off my M3  and I've narrowed my search down to two options. 

Volvo S60 T5 Momentum 31k miles @ $31,998

Overall, I have grown extremely fond of Volvos over the past few years. I love the styling, driving feel, interior and I was very surprised with how well just the T5 drove.

Hyundai Elantra Limited @$25,788 after incentives.

The Elantra, for me is the value buy and gives me an opportunity to rack up a ton of miles on it while being under warranty. Even though it isn't quite as engaging, I thought the limited interior was aestetically very nice and it had some pretty good bite for its power in sport mode. I also got 37.5mpg on a 35-minute test drive. 

In all, the Volvo is heads and shoulder the *better* car. But, the whole premise of me buying this car is to preserve my "fun" car and limit costs and the Elantra most definitely fulfills that slightly better while still offering enough enjoyment/comfort to meet my needs. I also know the Volvie will be more expensive to maintain. 

Lastly, is there anything I should take into consideration between both cars before making a choice?
-------------------------------

Clean title with 63,000 miles on it. The car is black and the interior is beige. Asking price was $18,800, but convinced him to let me take it for $17,600 CASH. Should I buy it??

I have to replace my beloved Honda Fit with a 4WD/AWD vehicle to live on my new property here in Maine. My Fit can make it down the road, but it is an almost 1 1/2 mile long private dirt road with a lot of rocks that kick up and big potholes. The Fit will get killed really quickly.

I will need to haul loads of things occasionally, but usually not more than an SUV with a roof rack can manage. If I need to carry really big loads I can rent/borrow a truck or use a trailer.

Initially, I wanted a pickup, but with gas prices as high as they are, I want to get a vehicle that will work for my purposes with the best gas mileage possible, so a small or midsized SUV is probably the best bet.

My budget is limited to what I can get for my Fit, and that looks like it will be about $5,000-$7,000. Hoping for another manual transmission, but will settle for automatic if I have to. Am considering traveling to below the rust line to find a vehicle that isn't already rusted out by salt. Thanks for any advice!

Unfortunately it met its maker. But I'm still here so there's that.

I've got two kids that I have to take to school, so needs a back seat.

Live in a place with lots of rain and sometimes snow, so AWD is a plus but not a requirement.

Manual would be nice

Long term thing so reliability is a bug bonus - - so I'm steering away from BMW, Mercedes

Budget around 40k

In the fast/fun category I'm looking at a Civic Type R or a Veloster N
In the nice and kind fast, a Golf R - - probably a Mk7 as I'm not a huge fan of the 8
In the comfy and not fast category:  Lexus LS460, GS, or if I can find one an IS F
In the totally sensible route:  Subaru Crosstrek or Outback, Camry with AWD, Rav4 Hybrid

Im looking at a Hyundai Elantra SEL to buy brand new since it is affordable and somewhat nice. Im just worried because it looks quite small compared to other cars on the road. I feel like it would get crushed in a crash with a large suv or truck. I just don't like how suvs look and they don't really suit me as a guy in my twenties.

Hey car dorks, looking for some armchair advice. Topic: salted roads.

We picked up a new car recently (2022 Model S). Our previous car, which we still have, is a 2009 Acura RL.

What I am trying to figure out is whether or not we should keep the RL. In about a year, our life circumstances will dictate that we will live in a state that salts their roads. We will live there for about 2-3 years.

What I am grappling with is whether or not to sell the RL. Ive put a lot of love into it and its in fabulous shape for a 12 year old car. But its also just a car and I wont be able to keep it nice forever. I was thinking we could maintain it for this upcoming year (battery, gas stabiliser, etc) and then bring it with us to the place that salts the roads. Then we can drive it in the winter (its got Hondas SH-AWD so thats neat) and let it suffer the effects of the rust, sparing the S.

It would also be nice to be able to downsize. Less cars. Less washings. Less paperwork (i.e., registration). A bit more money in our pockets. Plus there is never a circumstance where we need to be able to drive both cars simultaneously.

I have no fantasies about being able to keep the S is brand-new condition forever. Its a car and will be driven and, try as we might, will no doubt acquire some wear and tear. But, as someone from SoCal who knows pretty little first-hand of winter driving, we would consider keeping the RL if it would significantly help preserve the S in the more hostile environments/seasons.

So what would you do?

People always say get an electric car to save on gas, seems like a great idea with how gas prices are nowadays, but are they actually worth it? What about their reliability, cost of parts, infrastructure and overall aesthetic and feel of driving them?

Any electric car owners here with some insight?

Im starting to look to my next car and want a full EV. I currently have a Honda Element which I love but even with all that space it was not possible to get all our camping stuff in there with our dog needing a seat too (dog stayed with sister so she was set), so I am looking for something with a lot of space. This means lots of great looking EV options are just out. No Teslas, no sedans of any kind, I need something more and am not finding much besides the Ford F-150 Lightning or a Rivian truck. Is there anything else I overlooked or something on the horizon I should consider? Not looking to buy immediately so if I have to go on a list for next year thats ok. Thanks!

Got an offer to sell my VW lD4 and will make 12k- have a Tesla model 3 arriving in October/November. Need to buy a car to drive for 4-6 months then sell. Thinking about getting a new Tacoma because they hold their value so well. Anyone have any other suggestions? Open to also buying used.

Im looking for something good on gas, about 30mpg and reliable. I would also like a hatchback or a compact suv. I was looking into the hyundai kona but Im not sure about its long term reliability.

Looking for my first car and something reliable, fuel efficient and on a budget of about 20k. All of the advice on this sub advocates for the above trifecta - and I agree, those cars are some of the most reliable - but as a result they're the most in demand and the "get a toyota" comments aren't helpful when near me, a ten year old civic or corolla is going for $20k+, and new dealers either have nothing for months or are marking up $5k+ above MSRP. I don't have a car now so I can't expand my search radius that far, I need the car ASAP for work - what are some alternatives I could look at within budget?
-------------------------------

I'm looking for my next car, and I want something that looks very aggressive. My requirements are:

- Under 50K
- Used or new, no older than 2018
- Must be a sedan or sportback/liftback/gran coupe

What are my options?
-------------------------------

I am looking to buy a sportier car, but can't justify it given the insane prices for everything these days. By "sporty" I just mean something with a manual transmission, preferably a coupe, and handles well. I was looking at cars like the civic (si and non-si) coupe, celica, rsx, corolla xrs and any other Japanese cars that have a bit of fun to them. My issue is that all the cars have high mileage, 150k mi at least, and are also often modified and beaten up badly.

Recently however I came across a listing for a hyundai tiburon the, v6 6mt version, with only about 83k mi and asking around $2500. Car looks fine and decently maintained. I know that Hyundai's of that era don't have a good reputation for reliability, but I was wondering if this is still a good deal given the low mileage, price, and general condition of the car.

Hello all, just wanting some advice. I have been interested in cars my entire life but now as a 22 y/o am now taking the initiative to learn about cars mechanically since its always been a goal of mine to work on a car myself, no matter the scale of the project. I owned a 2017 Honda Civic Ex Coupe for some time and it was lovely but unfortunately due to peoples incompetence that beauty is totaled out :( To cut to the chase, I want a sporty-ish coupe that is easy to learn to work mechanically, while also having a nice, sleek look. I am not power crazy so horsepower isnt a dealbreaker however I would love to have fun with this car. Ive had my eyes on some e36/e46s and some older Lexus SCs, I just cant seem to make a decision. Really just came to this sub for some advice from some people who have had this same experience earlier in their life.

Side Note: I am in the process of learning how to drive manual so manual/rwd cars are recommended.

I bought the RDX as CPO a couple of months back for 51k including some accessories and pay $270 biweekly @6.99% for 5yrs. Drove it 4K km and found some issues: CarPlay doesnt work half the time, bad rattle in pano roof, driving position and top hinged pedal tiring on long drive. Interior and space are great but gas mileage is below estimates. Full warranty till Nov 23, powertrain till Nov 27. Reliable car but doesnt make me smile on solo drives unlike the CX-30 Turbo that I had before. 

The BMW dealer is giving me a trade value of $48.5k when I buy the X3 M40i for 59k ($306 biweekly @ 3.99 for 6yr). The CPO warranty ends Oct 23. 4 years extra is $5.6k and requires service at a BMW stealership. The back seats are smaller than Acura but still plenty big for carrying friends occasionally and may be a baby seat 2-3 years down the line. Concerns: Im not sure how long I keep it for but the internet tells me BMW are horrible to maintain out of warranty.


Context: 26 (M) immigrant making 140k CAD/yr with no debt other than car loan (29k now, 43k on BMW). Saving 2k/month to buy a house in next 2-3 years with my partner who has good savings. Growing up in a developing country the BMW X6 was my dream car. The current one is too bloated and X3 is similar sized to original.

Looking at buying my first car to go to work and back. Out of 20+ people Ive sent messages to, this is the first person who has responded in full sentences and seems genuine. Have spent dozens of hours the last month looking for a Corolla to no avail. I dont know much about cars and Ive been doing any kind of research through google and Reddit. I dont have any family or friends who know about cars that could go with me, and Im paying a neighbor to drive me to check out cars when they have time available. Im really intrigued by this car, but concerned about how much longer it may last. 

`2004 Solara with 200k miles and clean title. Claims to have been the only owner (which I have a hard time believing, she looks to be late 20s)`

`Ad is 6 months old, initially asked 6k, now listed for 3k`

`Last maintenance was 11 months ago in California. Lady moved to Texas in it. Hasnt driven since. Tags expire 02/23`

`Got a new car after moving here because of baby. Lives in upscale part of town with a very expensive looking house in the picture. Shes also selling baby stuff, so I dont feel this is a conspiracy to commit robbery or murder`

`No check engine light, claims no issues or leaks`

`Claims to have had it regularly maintained and says she has all the service records in the glove box. `

`Exterior in photos looks very good, interior looks pretty good. `

`Said her mechanic back in CA said it would last another 200k because of how good of shape it is.`

I know that Toyotas are pretty solid cars, Corollas in particular. Read that Solara is just a 2d Camry, and Camrys can do 200-300k. Could find very little information on how long a Solara could realistically last. One website said 200k, but if theyre basically a Camry??

My budget is about 3500. Im confident I could haggle my way down a significant amount, but I just dont know if any amount is worth It. Would appreciate any help anyone could offer with this.

Both cars are priced similar that I am comparing, and both are listed as CPO by the dealerships. 

I plan on driving 15k miles annually, and will look to keep this next purchase for 7-8 years. Which would you choose based on reliability and limiting total cost of ownership?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-19
Basically between these two. I live in the DC area, I am currently working 45 minutes away from the city, but during school I wont need to drive that much. 
Im a car enthusiast so I want something fun, and ideally would get the GR86, but I dont know if it would work as a daily and in the winter. Otherwise the WRX on paper would be a fantastic daily but it isnt great on gas.
-------------------------------

Looking to buy a compact SUV, fed up with used car prices. 

Here is my list of choice?
1. KIA Sportage for the looks, Tech and features with a decent car.
2. Subaru Forester for being one of the most reliable, value for money and practicality.

Eliminated RAV4 for it's dated feature, CRV since it feels pricer than it offers. CX5 since it's small and expecting parent here.

What do you think about the choice? Please give your opinion.

I'm moving with my wife from Canada to the US (specifically Georgia) and have never owned a vehicle. She just wants to get a sedan and we're not picky due to the wait times for vehicles (likely a civic of some trim).

As for me, it's a bit more complex. While her car will just be a commuter, the one I'll be getting is our "fun and long term" vehicle. After reading up on vehicles for half a year I still have no idea what we should get and finding vehicles to test drive in our area is almost impossible. Our company has a car buying service but with the shortage it means we don't really have time to test them before we buy. We are buying new so i want to make sure i get this right. Here's what we will be doing:

- Weekend adventures across the state and neighboring ones (with camping!)
- significant DIY around our home
- 20 mile round trip commute to work three days a week
- Ideally good gas mileage however when you see what I'm looking at below you'll know I'm likely not listening to this
- Want the vehicle to have some kind of personality to it - nice to drive and large enough for the major highways to feel safe and secure. 
- I do like tech in the car

Here's what I was considering:

1. Rav4 Hybrid/Prime XSE: top contender though the wait is quite long/about as long as my dream vehicle below. Seems to fit the bill except someone once told me, "It's great, it's just more like an appliance than a car" which I can't get out of my head. Also not sure if the plug in is worth it for our purposes. They say they can get the all gas versions faster.

2. Mazda CX5/50: A bit less appliance than the above but with worse mileage and not sure how it would hold up for actual weekend adventuring/camping.

3: Ford F150 Lariat: Despite having never driven a truck, I've always wanted one. Im also moving to America which is symbolic for me and the F150 is kind of a part of that. Obvious downsides are mileage, price, and commuting/parking. Also pretty sure that this is the worst time in recent history to buy a truck. I've also looked at the Honda Ridgeline but feel I'd regret not getting the F150/full size. But I kinda really want it.

Others in Consideration: Jeep Wrangler - I have no justification for this and I've heard the steering in the city can be brutal as it is designed for off road but it has the spirit I'm after.

Any advice, other considerations to continue to confuse me, or mockery would be appreciated.

Ive had my license for almost 4 years but Im just looking for a car as Ive now got the need for it. Ive got a budget of around 6-7k. 
Im currently a medical student that would be driving  30-40 miles a day to placement, so need something thats reliable and also relatively cheap to maintain. I dont know a lot about cars, so any help/advice would be appreciated. Thanks

I really want a new Toyota Corolla, but they are being marked up too much. I love Toyotas and know they hold their value but its still hard for me to pay 21K for a 2016-2019 used one with 60k+ miles (just an example). I was looking at a new Kia Rio S (same price 21k), but read they dont hold their value and arent as reliable compared to Toyota. I was considering the possibility of trading in when the car market gets closer to normal. Considering that, what do you guys think?
-------------------------------

I need something that is more suitable for kids and two large dogs. Definitely want a Plug In Hybrid due to the cost of fuel. Ive been burnt before by car repairs on my current 2011 VW Polo and want something newer. 

Mitsubishi Outlander? What other alternatives are there in this price range that are suitable? 

Essentials:
- Automatic Transmission 
- Space for 2 labradors + children
- Hybrid
- Apple Carplay
- Cruise Control
- DAB Radio
- Parking sensors

Nice to haves:
- Dual climate control

Thank you car people x

Honestly idk how the market is nowadays but hopefully something under $6,000 would be ideal but idk if thats too low. 

Mainly looking for a car thats easy for a beginner to learn to work on cars and modify them. And relatively fast/and or just fun ti take to a local track. 

Automatic or Manual I dont mind.

Thank you!

Im looking at a lincon town car 04 ultimate rn with 120k for 6k and a Mercury GM 01 with 55k for 5.5k , Im curious how the reliability is on both of them, I need something smooth to get from a to b in some style and have low maintenance and minimal chances of breaking down on the road as Ill be taking it on long drives. Ive been doing a lot of research and these seem to be the most fitting for my needs.

I miss the lightweight go kart feeling of my old S2000 but I'm not willing to spend so much money on such an old car. 

I'm torn between these 2. Both look equally good in my eyes but I'm not sure if the M2s extra power offsets the added heft over the 86. Power is always nice but if the M2 feels like a GT car rather than a sports car compared to the 86 then 230hp is enough lol. I've read some reviews saying the M2 has better turn in?

I am looking to buy a Miata, and this will be my first car. I found a private party near my place selling a 2005 mx-5 MazdaSpeed. Clean title; 101k miles. I have seen [vehiclehistory.com](https://vehiclehistory.com) report and there are no accidents reported (4 owner history). I have compared it to quite a lot of other listings and though by no means this is a *great deal,* I feel it's fair in the current market. What do you guys think? 

The condition in the pictures looked decent. I will ask them for pictures from under the car, I suspect there might be rust. I will obviously get an inspection done before the purchase as well. What else should I do or look for? What is a *steal* price for this car &amp; mileage?

Need to buy a car, looking for a reliable car. I just need a car for around town, to and from work, errands, etc. Just want something reliable, preferably with cheap parts/repairs, and decent gas mileage. Mainly looking at sedans but open to a wagon or hatchback, maybe a small pickup. Need to be able to drive in snow, I live in Montana. I have at max $5,500 to spend. Doesnt need to be pretty. Just reliable and inexpensive. Cheers!

Hi guys, Im going to buy my first car soon and I wanted to ask for some advice. Im currently on a low budget, so my current options are:
-Toyota Auris Hatchback
-Toyota Aygo Hatchback
-Fiat 500 1.2 Lounge 3dr
-Vauxhall Corsa
-Citroen C1/C3

Out of these models, which one would be the best combination of reliable+low maintenance costs?
I am not looking to use this car a lot, probably will do around 8,000 miles per year on it max. 
Also, when checking out the car at the dealership, what questions should I ask and what should I look out for in the car when inspecting it? I will not be able to test drive the car because I dont have my license yet.
Thanks!

(Planning on purchasing new 2022/2023) 

This is a big purchase for me. Ive been driving the same car for 13 years (97 Camry). Very reliable car but it is aesthetically a beater. It has 240k, I want to get a car before it doesnt work anymore. Ive been saving money for 2 years to finally get myself a dream car. 

I really wanted a RAV4 for the past 3 years. Love the sporty interior with the textured knobs ect.. and really want an suv to go on trips/travel and take the pets with us. I test drove the RAV4 and took a 2 hour trip. My back hurt so badly. I was in the passenger seat so I didnt have any automatic seat controls but It was brutal and hurt the entire trip there and back. 

My second choice is the Nissan Rogue. I watched YouTube videos and it looks very nice other than the small display. Have not test drove this yet. 

Any recommendations between the two and why and why not? 

Thank you!!

Hey everyone!

Been looking for a fun around the town car.  Have a family car and another one.  This would be something fun to drive on local errands and take to an occasion Cars and Coffee or meet up.  

Recently saw an ad for a 1998 Neon R/T Sedan.  The car has an astonishing 18k miles total.  Pictures show the factory red paint is in terrible shape.  A slight blemish to the front driver quarter panel.  But the interior appears to be very well kept.  The pictures are limited.  I have contacted the seller and they are pretty firm on the $1800 asking price.  The seller is an older woman who's selling her husband's old car.  He apparently LOVED the car but couldn't continue to drive it do to heath complications.  He then passed away.  Car has been sitting for some time and only driven occasionally.  It has passed smog and has had minimal service work done in it's 18,000 mile existance.  

I have talked to some folks and everyone says why on earth would you want a dodge neon they are terrible cars!  But I don't think they understand the significance of this vehicle!  I am definitely blinded by some of the admiration on the internet for these cars from YouTubers like Doug Demuro and Regular Car review guy.  Am I crazy to want this car??  I am going to see it tomorrow.  

The R/Ts have the same engine as the ACR models which revs to 7500rpm and has 150hp.  R/Ts are equiped with stiffer suspension for sturdier handling and tighter feel.  

Things I'm unsure of ... Head gasket issue that apparently these cars have.  Timing belt issues?  Very low milage but does it need to be changed anyway?  Those are the main ones. 

Anyway... Just kinda freaking out because these cars are very nestalgic and quite rare, but known also to be pretty terrible cars ha.  But so many people say they are great.  

Should I buy it!?

Im trying to decide on a new daily car to buy right now Im mainly looking between an F90 M5 Comp and a Model S Plaid. If any owners have anything they like/dislike about each car let me know!

To preface this post, I've owned a lot of cars this last few years, about 7 and counting because I can't find the car. And I plan on keeping going till I find the one.

I found an 1992 Miata Hardtop in Mariner Blue with 40k miles and a single owner. They are willing to part with this Miata for about 8k. VERY CLEAN Miata, 100% stock.

My dilemma is that I currently have a beater 2014 Civic Si Coupe, salvage title with 68k miles that I bought for 10k from an auction. I love the Civic, but I hate the steering feel, it just feels incredibly numb. I had to replace the subframe on this car, motor mounts and installed a short shifter. This car has been great and haven't had any issues besides having to replace an AC compressor, few cosmetics issues from crappy Honda paint peeling and someone reversing a tow hitch into my fender. 

Would this be a smart trade? I don't care for space, my wife has a nice Lexus ES that we take everywhere and this is just for my commute to and from work.

Im interested in buying something new. I dont mind buying something from 2020-2021. My requirements are:

25-35 MPG, 
Reliable,
Sedan.

Ive been looking at a 2022 Honda Civic Ex for 26.5K. Something around the same price point is good as well.

My beloved commuter (2004 Volkswagen Passat GLX wagon) of the last 4 years recently became too much to repair, so I'm looking to get into my wife's car (2007 Ford Focus SES wagon) and get her a newer car. We're trying to stay with a 4 cylinder, nothing that requires premium gas, and her only ask is heated seats. Her commute is 24 miles a day and about 75% highway. Any recommendations for what to look for or avoid on a budget up to about 12k would be great.

I am looking at a 1986 325e 2door on my local Craigslist. It looks to be in good condition from the photos, everything clean and no rust. Has 140,000 on the odometer and the seller is asking $6800. 

However I would have to sell my current car, a 1998 Subaru Impreza wagon. I am the second owner and it has 138,000 miles. I was given all the maintenance records and it looks like it was taken care of meticulously, brought to dealership for service etc. I purchased it for $4300. 

Logically it seems like it would be smarter to keep my car in the long run, given that I know most of its history and lots of preventative maintenance was done. 

I have always been a fan of bmw however (owned an e34 in the past) and frankly I think a black e30 would be pretty sweet to own. Im sure insurance would go up with the e30 as well (Im 18 so that doesnt give me much leeway). 

Both cars are 5-speed manuals. I think Id enjoy driving the bmw more but half of my brain is telling me to be practical. Any thoughts? (And thank you for reading!)

Hello, I'm a teen and I'm looking for a good first car that will hopefully last me through college. I definitely want to go the good and cheap route. My must have list is pretty short: good MPG (25-35), clean title and safe. Something a little sporty would be the cherry on top, but I know I can't have it all in my first car.This would be my daily driver to school and work. I was looking at the Mazda 3 because I loved the look of the interior and its other features, but I can't find any cheap ones with lower mileage (trying to stay under 120k). I have about 4k saved right now and I'm planning to purchase something in August. Would it be a good idea to use that money for a down payment and go the financing route through my parents? I was thinking this would be good since I don't want to waste money on something older I'd have to replace in 2 or 3 years. Just let me know which cars you think I should keep looking for. I may even make a spreadsheet 
-------------------------------

My budget is about $80k and I was considering getting either a BMW i8 or a Corvette C8, both used. I'm not a car person at all but I've always wanted to give an exotic looking car a try, sadly wasn't able to do a car rental due to age limit. I don't care much about high speed performance, wanted an exotic looking car and wanted something that I could use every day. Would also prefer a convertible as well. I'll be the only one driving most of the time so a 2 seater is fine.

i8 has caught my attention as of lately because of those reasons but my only concern is how parking is going to work because of the doors going upwards. My questions are:

- For the i8, how would I deal with the parking?

- Which one of these cars would be better suited for my use case?

- Are there any other cars that I should consider?

Thanks!

I am looking for an SUV with sedan like handling. Is it even possible to find one or its just a dream? 
Any brand , is okay execpt for the exotic and super-luxury ones.

Pretty straight forward. I have some redundancy between my M2 and my Lotus Evora. My M2s clutch has been bothering me due to an injury to my left leg. 

Looking to replace the M2 with a lux sedan. 

Some thoughts:

- Id like something that is different. As much as I love the interior and feel of an E class, theyre everywhere. Something slightly different would more to front of list. 
- $35-50k 
- Already have an SUV (2022 Telluride SX), so most likely a sedan but could be swayed

Some initial thoughts: go E class because its great, used Panamera, love the exterior of Gulia but meh interior. 

What else would you recommend?

Hi,

I'm deciding between getting the 2022 Accord Sport 2.0T (non CVT) vs the 2022 Accord Hybrid. I am able to get both at MSRP and am wondering if the drive is that different between the 2. If it's similar to drive I'd probably just go for the fuel savings although it isn't that big of a deal. Also, is it true that there isn't any difference in the drive between the Accord Hybrid and the Hybrid Sport?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks

I'm hoping to get a new car soon and im choosing between these 4 models: 

* Toyota Rav 4
* Hyundai Tuscon
* Ford Escape
* Honda CRV

I'm looking at hybrid options preferably, as i use my car a lot for work--commuting and driving around to different sites (i'm a health educator). I know there are different trims (?), so I'd love some input on that as well. I also visit family a lot and we're a bit spaced out from each other, and I do plan on doing some long distance road travel, so I do need a durable vehicle that'll last me. I do drive with my nephews and nieces often, so safety for children is also a plus. I live in Bay Area, California. 

I'm looking at anywhere between 2020-2022. The main things I'm really looking for in a car is:

* good mileage, again i travel A LOT for work, and drive family around, pretty much drive everyday
* affordability--I know hybrids aren't cheap so I'm looking anywhere around 35k (+ or - a couple thousand)
* Ample cargo space since I generally carry my dad's wheelchair around and carry items for work
* PLUS: I'd also like a good sound system, but that's not really as important obviously lol 

I plan on checking out these cars to get a feel of how they drive, but any input on these cars and the specific trims/models is very helpful, as I don't know too much about cars. Also, would like to know general price ranges as I don't want to be skimped on a car either, basically living on a teachers salary :(, but I have support from family in hleping me buy. I used to drive a Mazda 3 but that recently broke down on me back in April (something about the transmission/computer operation system failing) and i've been borrowing family members cars since, so I'd really like my own car ASAP. Thank you in advance!

Just sold my 2014 sonata and looking to make an upgrade. Would like to get in the luxury space but heard bad things about the Audi A3 and the new integra didnt feel luxury to me. Having a hard time deciding if its worth 30k for a sonata n line. Had eyes on k5 gt 2020 gulia and gr68.

I am looking at a 2007 lexus es350 for 6k.  It has 117k miles.  A dent in left rear door, some paint peeling on the roof.  Has decent tires, fairly new starter and fuel pump.  Ac isn't blowing super cold though.  

Also found an 06 jetta with 193k.  It's a 6 speed with 2.0 turbo.  That one is $1500.  And it has a check engine light but I haven't seen the car in person yet.  

Which would you get?  And maybe what should I look for when checking these cars more thoroughly?

I got my license recently and Im looking to buy my first car. Im willing to spend under 28k at the highest but Id rather under 25k including fees. 

Im open to any make and model of car, but Ive been looking into Mazda. I liked carbon edition but dont want to spend that much on a car yet. 

I am unsure if I should get a new or used car. I dont want a used car with cloth. I want something reliable and safe.

Im looking for

Suv if possible
2018 or newer
Low mileage 
Backup camera
Leather (unless new then maybe cloth is ok?)
Moonroof(if possible)


Ive looked into a 2020 Mazda CX-5 grand touring for about $24k and 60k miles. Or a Mazda 3 grand touring hatchback for about $21.5k and 68k miles. I can link them if needed. Im not sure if the mileage is bad.

Hello, all. I hope someone with knowledge can give a proper lowdown on the Mazda RX-8?

I have read in places that this vehicle should be completely avoided for several reasons. I was hoping that someone that owns one or has owned one could help me out?

(I am looking at the possible purchase of a 2005 Mazda RX-8 Shinka at 93k miles or a 2006 at 110k miles)

Thank you!!

Im lookin for a turbo sedan that I can get for around $30k or less. 

I was originally looking at a Jetta GLI, or a Kia K5 GT, but I dont really have any K5s available in my area, so I was wondering if any of yall had any suggestions.

Since there are no K5s I was more stuck between the GLI or an MQB A3 but their 4yr/50,000 warranty seems a little low. 

My only needs would probably be decent gas mileage since its so expensive right now.

I've moved to Santa Clara, CA recently and have been considering getting a car, but the problem is I'm not sure how long will I be staying, I could be leaving the area in 6 months to a year from now. I've been searching around for quite a while for long-term rentals or short-term leases but the cost would add up to more than if I just pay for rideshare, deliveries and rent for road trips ($700 - $1000). Would really appreciate some suggestions on what options should I consider!

So far I've looked at the following:

\- Traditional car rentals / Turo would be extremely expensive due to underage driver's fee

\- Lyft rental which is about $1100 tax incl. for 28 days

\- Car subscriptions like Volvo (which isn't available in CA), Lexus (which discontinued), Porsche (there's never an option available under $2000)

\- Buying a cheap car then sell it later is way more expensive than it sounds because of the insane mark up on used cars and costs of transaction

\- Zipcar but it's rather inconvenient and availability is limited

My budget would be around $800/mo for a Corolla-equivalent and $2000/mo for like a Macan.

Thank you!

I decided on a golf for my first car most likely  i wanted a gti but I'm worried that they will be absolutely molested so i was thinking just a normal 2.0 golf.

What mileage should i aim for?

Ill probably swap the exhaust regardless and maybe rims because I want good sound and for it to look nice.

Also open to other suggestions on a kinda fast, reliable and good looking car.

I'm looking for a cheap, great MPG first car that isn't a clapped-out Prius. I came across a 2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid in my area on Craigslist with 171,765.8 miles on the odometer that they want $5,500 for. 

Will this be a reliable, safe first car for a 16-year-old dude? And will insurance be through the roof?

Thanks.

Hello! Im super new to buying cars and I need to make a decision between two cars, Im looking at a 2017 Nissan rouge sv with 82,000 miles for $19,500 (after tax and fees) and a 2016 Chevy trax with 60,000 miles for $14,000 (before tax, with tax and all the fees itll probably be $16-$17,000 not sure?). Both are in good condition with the trax only having been in a super minor fender bender. To be completely honest we have a very small budget and the Nissan is pushing it but we really want the most reliable car we can get, I need to choose one by Monday so if anyone can give me any advice I would be so grateful, thank you!

Hey there,
Im currently driving a hyundai i10 2017 plate (currently in the garage). I bought it from arnold clark in september but wanting to trade it in and get another car as i drive 100 miles a day monday to friday (50 miles to work and 50 miles back). Im spending roughly 400 a month on petrol alone, 130 on the car finance and 65 on insurance. 
I would go for an electric car but there are no chargers near where i stay, closest is about an hours walk. (Commute to work is roughly 50 minutes/hour so not wanting to be wasting more time every day). 
I was thinking of a hybrid car but not sure what cars would be best to go for under 200 a month that would save me more money in petrol than the cost for the car.
Current finance is for 5 years plan.

Any advice/help would be great, if i should post this somewhere else please let me know. 

Thanks in advance!

Ill be honest I love techy luxury feeling cars. But I recently got out of a Ford Focus with transmission issues and its been such a nightmare. 

Im enticed by the Toyotas durability but equally enticed by Hyundais tech, interior space, lux feel, and warranty. The dealership I would purchase from also throws in a LIFETIME power train warranty. 

So what say you?

Im thinking of leasing a 2022 camaro. I know that leasing I basically pay $20,000 just to rent a car for 3 years. 

However I only plan on leasing because I would really love this car but I know that in the future Im going to need something more economical on gas, say a Toyota or Honda. ( the Toyota and Honda I would finance)

The big what if is what if I fall in love with the leased camaro and dont even care about the MPG anymore.

Would it be a bad idea to pay for the buyout amount at that point?

(Very indecisive so I would really appreciate your guys help!!!)


Have a good day by the way!!!

Im about to move into a house in the suburbs that will involve a commute of 80 miles (40 miles each way). Almost all of that is highway. 

I dont have a car currently, so nothing to trade in. 

I would like to spend $30k max. 

Im not opposed to EV or hybrid. 

Ill need to pull the trigger soon, so a 6-month waitlist isnt going to work. 

Im in Louisiana.

Im a teacher and will be driving 70-75 miles M-F 10 months of the year. With gas prices and a newborn baby, I need to get a hybrid that is smoother to drive. My wife has a 2013 Prius C class which is beating my 2014 Nissan Sentra SR in mpg and the comfort of driving. It feels pointless to get a second Prius, but I should be able to trade in my car for a little over $5,000. I plan on financing the car and coming up with a payment plan to boost my credit score.


This is what Im looking for in a car:
1. Gas mileage
2. Family friendly (can seat a car seat and a booster seat in the back easily with leg room)
3. Back up camera
4. Nice interior - Apple CarPlay
5. Cargo space (preferred to have a spare tire included)

After doing research Ive looked into the following cars:

* Honda Accord Hybrid ELX
* Hyundai Sonata Hybrid
* Toyota Corolla Hybrid
* Honda Insight

I am a college student looking to buy my first car to take to school. I will be driving between Seattle and Santa Barbara so this will add on miles quite quickly before the end of college. Im also an avid rock climber and would want to store climbing gear and crush some dirt roads. Above average fuel economy would also be a plus for my wallet. My budget is around 10k, and I would want this car to last around 5 years. I was looking at Honda Civic, Toyota Matrix, Subaru Impreza, Mazda 3. Are any of these a clear better option. I have found models for all of these around 6-10k.

Aware that current car market is super inflated. But I NEED to buy a car - I'd personally avoid buying till end of the year but need car ASAP due to back to work and some personal road trips coming up. Need an opinion on how should I go about it 

It will be financed &amp; budget is 15-16K (more below)

Option 1- 2008-2012 beater car (saw some options for 10-12k, but not great condition/no features at all)

Option 2 - increase the budget little bit and get a 2014-2016 Honda or Toyota (~100K miles )

Avoiding - CPO and New Cars since they might depreciation a lot 

Concerns - most probably I'll make a loss no matter what car I purchase other than new car once price drops. Just want to minimize the loss

Open to suggestions - any particular year to check or manufacturer outside of Honda or Toyota? 

Original plan was to get a Honda or Toyota for 8-10k, but nothing fits in.

Before posting this I've made attempts to YouTube / Google different insights to a question I know has been asked. The issue I'm running into is the variability in answers. I thought I'd try my hand to directly ask here, with the ability to ask follow up questions if needed.

What I'm looking for is advice on Brand / Models of SUVs. Beyond the personal choice I need to make about Size vs. Gas Mileage in an environment where gas prices are soaring, I need to narrow down the brand we are comfortable purchasing.

Example:  I went to drive a Honda CRV &amp; Pilot, to get a feel, and the guy ends up showing me a Hyundai Santa Fe. I felt the Santa Fe was a better ride than the CRV. I go home and Google Hyundai as a brand and I see everything from "steaming pile" to "getting better" and even "Santa Fe is top in reliability".  I've yet to find a pattern in 2020+ Hyundai reliability.

Our Needs:

* Looking for a mid-size SUV for the family of 4
* Trying to decide between something like a Pilot (bad gas mileage) and a CRV (bit too small)
* Really hung up on brand right now. Having a better idea of brand would allow me to go figure out car model faster.
* Would prefer to keep the car 10+ years.
* Where I think I'm at now:
   * Toyota / Honda preferred
   * Read FORD is good at SUV / Trucks and I may consider the Ford Edge
   * Trying to be open minded to Kia / Hyundai / Nissan
      * Friend has a Nissan Rogue and swears by it, but I think its too new for him to really know.
   * We own a Chevy Equinox and it's had an array of issues. I question if an upgraded Equinox / Traverse is even an option. 
   * Another buddy swears by Volkswagen. I'm unclear as I haven't really seen them come up in google searches for SUVs. I suspect they'd be more expensive to maintain. (I've no idea)

While I think size vs gas mileage is something I need to figure out, I appreciate any input on Brand with a 2019 - 2022 vehicle. Price plays some factor. Obviously Kia / Hyundai you get more bang for the buck. Though, I'd rather have a more reliable, less feature rich, vehicle than a loaded out one. 

I appreciate any input as I go down this road. Honestly with the recession I'm not really sure I want to buy now, but think it will be good to get ahead of increased interest rates, as well as our older vehicle is starting to have several maintenance needs  at 140k.  -Thanks

So my husband and I are thinking of buying a second-hand 2018 Nissan Juke 1.6L CVT AT from a popular dealer in the Philippines. First owner, 30k km mileage, and seems to be well-maintained. The price is at the market average but we actually wouldn't mind paying a little bit more by buying from a dealer because of the convenience.

I have to say also that he and I both have minimum car knowledge (I don't drive) - our only requirements coming to the dealer were our budget,1.5L engine and up, and not older than 2018.  Our ideal choice was to get an SUV but it wasn't possible because of our budget. So we were happy to see the Juke because it's a little bit higher than a sedan (Flooding from typhoons is a constant problem here in our tropical country)

We mostly relied on youtube videos to help us decide, and were actually already satisfied with what we'd heard about the car that we already paid for the reservation fee. But then 2 days later, I thought to check on Reddit what people have to say about it and was surprised to see so much hate lol.

We honestly don't mind the cons we initially came across (design, small-ish trunk, backseat space), and the CVT issues seem to be associated more with the older models, so is there something else that we're missing? 

So I guess what I really want to know is - is it all just petty hate bec people find it ugly, or should we think twice about going through with the purchase? What are legit reasons that make the Juke a bad car?

Lease for a Volvo XC90 is expiring, we were paying $650 for a fully loaded T6 Inscription. Getting a lease for XC90 would cost $1200+ now, which is crazy. So, inquiring to see what's the best we can get for the same $600-700 range we were paying and 2-3k down. Looking at Toyota Highlanders, Grand Cherokees, but open to any other suggestions.

I got a budget of 18k Eur, I'm gonna drive the car to work each day (60km total a day). So I prefer something fast with good fuel economy and some kind of reliability. Have been looking on 330d with the n57 engine or the lesser fun slower 4 pot 320d. Any other tips on a fast(ish) car?

I have been considering upgrading my car and what I am looking at is a hybrid lexus, something like the es 300. I honestly dont know too many options. I want a somewhat sporty looking hybrid sedan. My budget is 50k. Also if we can pm whether its worth the trading in my current car considering finances and all that, thanks.

Hi everyone,

I am a newcomer and want to buy my very first car. The price for used cars right now is just crazy so I think it is better to get a new one.

I am wondering between Elantra sun and tech package and Mazda 3 GS. Based on dealers' websites near my location, the price for the Elantra is lower (more than 1k).

My wife and I are still not sure what should we pick. We know that Mazda has a better reputation, and the interior looks better, while Elantra is more spacious.

So, please spare some time let us know your opinion or experience. Thank you so much!

My parents are looking for a new car due to the rule changes by next year etc at the city

They are looking for (Their own words)

-A Sonic blue colour if possible, like this https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.shutterstock.com%2Fimage-illustration%2Fblue-generic-sedan-car-isolated-260nw-673558765.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Fsearch%2F%25E9%259D%2592%25E3%2581%2584%25E8%25BB%258A&amp;docid=IDeCuryyI1s8ZM&amp;tbnid=mJJzVPEWUYNKUM&amp;vet=1&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim

-Semi-Hybrid. Aka Rechargable, not pluggable 

-USB for recharging devices (They want to know their Wattage to see if they have either a basic 15W Fast Charging for capable FC phones/devices or faster)

-Small SUV

-Navigator screen

-Be able to connect our phones to the car so, for example, use VLC to listen to music (basicly. If there are video then good but not necessary) and calls.

-Parking sensors at the rear mainly, but if they have front sensors too the better (Aka when they have to park, hear the caution beepings, beeping faster the closer they reach an obstacle)

-If possible a big trunk

-Popular brands like PEUGEOT, NISSAN , TOYOTA, KIA, SEAT, RENAULT

Thanks in advance

Basically as the title says, I need to get my license pretty soon so I can get to and from my job (~45 mins away) and be able to travel with my partner, but my top priority is something that will make me feel like Im not taking a big risk when I go on the road. Obviously some things are just out of our hands, but if I can help it I would. Ive never had a car before so Id like to shoot for under 7,000, preferably under 5,000 just so I can have room for life expenses but no big deal if not. Basically, my top priority is something that feels safer than some other cars on the market, while also being reliable and able to allow me to travel 7-8 hours at a time if need be. Does anyone have any good recommendations?
-------------------------------

Very nervous right now, Im not very knowledgeable about cars so when I go car shopping I go with my dad. Tomorrows the last day of my current lease (a 2018 honda hr-v) and Thursday I found a Subaru that I could pick up immediately AND they can take my lease off my hands. Really good deal, best Ive seen after weeks of car shopping. 

That being said, I told the salesperson about how Ive always wanted a Subaru (particularly a crosstrek, which is currently out of my price range and doesnt come in until next week at the earliest) bc of the safety ratings. Im a very very nervous driver and I want to feel safe in my car. Im also going to school in the fall which is about 45 minute commute, so I told them I didnt want to risk missing class for a little bad weather. 

She showed me and my dad this Subaru Impreza sport and listed all the safety ratings and whatnot and completely sold me. Im going there in literally two hours to sign the paperwork and pick it up. 

However, when I showed my mom the car, shes like it has low profile tires?!  Theyre 18" Aluminum-Alloy Wheels w/ 225/40 R18 Tires. Which Im learning only just now are supposedly AWFUL in snow and bad weather and Im on Long Island, NY- our roads are absolutely not pristine and perfectly smooth . 

Called the salesperson and they were like I only drive with these all-weather low profile tires bc I like the way they look. We can go over the tire insurance package (estimated around $900) when you come in. Ive blown my tire out three times in the last two years and theyve covered everything! And I only had to wait like 45 minutes. 

None of that made me feel any better. 

Should I cancel this purchase? My only other option at this point is to borrow money from my parents and buy out the Honda HR-V which I really dont want to do.  send help, links, advice, anything please

Hey, Im looking for an SUV that will be reliable enough to do a 2000 mile road trip with no issues. Needs to be big enough to hold 2 large dog crates in the back with the seats folded down. Budget is 10-15k, I dont really care how old the car is if its reliable. 4WD is necessary. Right now Im looking at 1st gen Toyota Sequoias and Ford/Lincolns with the 4.6 v8 as Ive heard those are pretty reliable. 

Looking for any and all input, thanks!

I had a 2011 Camry which I had to sell because I had to leave the states. Now that I am back but at an unfortunate time, literally everything seems so expensive. I live at a very car dependent place and would need something soon. Ideally, I'd have got a used (2012-2018)Camry under 14k with fair mileage but this doesn't seem a viable option now. Looking for some suggestion on what to get.

WFH, just daily errands, and occasional sight seeing nearby roughly 6k/year at the most.

Hey everyone.  Looking for any insight anyone may have.  Attempting to cosspost between r/askcarsales and r/whatcarshouldibuy.

My commute is 120 miles/day, but I currently only have to go in on Wednesday/Thursday.  However there is no guarantee this is permanent and I do expect it to move to 3 days a week in the nearish future.

I currently have a Tacoma lease that is up in November (way under miles).  I got a great deal on the lease, but buying it out would have a hefty monthly payment and with current gas prices the commute would be expensive.

In my search, Ive narrowed it down to three options:
1. VW Jetta SEL Premium - this has all the features I would be looking for and claims to get about 40mpg highway for about $30k plus tax.
2. Toyota Corolla Hybrid - this doesnt have all the features Id like, but does have some and does claim to get just above 50 mpg highway for about $25k plus tax.
3. Chevy Bolt EUV - with chevys new pricing incentive of ~$6k and no sales tax on EVs in NJ has most of the features I want for about $31k.  Looks like Chevy will even cover the cost of the 240v outlet to charge at home.

Any thoughts on these options?

How hard is it to get these vehicles?

Can I do a third party buyout on my Tacoma if I go with the Chevy or VW to capture any equity?

Is the Bolt EUV sufficient for my commute?  How is this technology?  I know they did have battery issues, but it seems they handled the recalls well.

Thanks for your input.

I want a reliable car that gets good gas mileage, but still has a fun sporty factor to it. I feel like the Honda Civics fit that bill nicely, but they aren't as easy to find in the coupe form. Is this price and mileage a decent deal? or should I keep waiting?

So never in my life would I have considered a hybrid before, but with current gas prices, and the likelihood they stay this way for 2-3 years I think it could make sense.

Some questions:

- I know Honda did a redesign around 2018 for their standard accord (when they switched to the 1.5t and 2.0t engine as well), and was originally targeting a 2019 2.0t as a sweet spot. Did Hybrids also switch over in 2018?
- Any other quirks I should watch out for with hybrids? I definitely will do a mechanic pre-purchase inspection
- Should I just go older? What's the typical battery pack life and replacement cost? If I saw a good deal I wouldn't mind having the battery replaced, but assuming a 3rd party one would be ~ $3k or so installed.

Wife and I need an upgrade. Were running a 208 and a juke but  were lacking space with our son. Weve been looking at hybrids like the xc40/60 or EVS like the ID4 but the main question I keep asking myself is if this is the right time to make the transition to electric. We go on summer vacations and the range on the ID4 isnt great, like 350km, and it just seems like a hastle to plan out your route for charge stations. On the other hand battery tech is improving and I see countless articles claiming massive upgrades in battery capacity coming soon*TM*. So my question is should we wait for an improvement in EV tech?

So, the car market appears to be strange. Three year old leased vehicles seem to be the placeholder for new cars, and go for the same prices. 

I'm interested in opinions about what cars I may not have considered that I should, and what, of the things I'm considering, will be the least-regrettable choice. 

I'm looking for something compact to midsize. I like low to the ground more than raised. I like a wagon / SUV / Hatchback back more than a sedan trunk. I appreciate some power, but I rarely go over the speed limit. I appreciate a nice interior. I'm a big handling snob. I'm from a cold place and favor AWD, but it's not essential. I have a kid, and may have more during my ownership of this car, so ability to put multiple child seats in the back is important. 

I favor simple elegance and function over lots and lots of options.

My car history, most recent first:

Yesterday I test drove a Nissan Rogue, a Subaru Forester, a Subaru Impreza and a Toyota RAV4. I strongly favored the Impreza. I liked the interior of the Forester a little more but it was much higher trim. I liked the handling of the RAV4 a little more than the Forester, but not the Impreza. The Nissan Rogue was really disappointing in every way (handling, acceleration, interior, shifting). 

My last car was a 2003 BMW 530i. I loved everything about it except for it's fuel efficiency and snow struggles. In particular, it felt more like a mechanical than an electronic machine. That acceleration. That interior (minus the faux-walnut). I drove it for one year. It's transmission just died. I doubt I'll see it's like again. 

I drove a 2015 Honda Odyssey before that. It did everything I ever asked of it. It did it's level best to make me feel like I was driving an Accord, not a boat. It was not 100% successful. On a car like that, I guess I appreciate the electric details. But let's stipulate "not the car for me" for this round. Although, shout-out to minivans when you're moving apartments. 

Before that I drove a Subaru Impreza for 11 years. I loved that thing, and it was unbelievably reliable. I do like a nicer interior than that, but whatever. Blizzards. Handling. Low maintenance. I didn't have to think about my car. I could go where I wanted to go and do what I wanted to do with it. 

I learned to drive on a ten year old 1990 Acura legend. Great car. On a lark I looked up what they're worth now. Reminded me of that time I passed on 1000 Bitcoin...

I figured "a used Prius". But they're shockingly expensive. No hybrids simply because they're so inflated right now. 

I'm okay with something not-optimal if it's likely to really hold it's valu so I can get something better when the market settles down, so I'm open to "drive a Kia for a year or two" if that's the best move. 

I'd like no worse than say 25mpg. I'd like a driving experience somewhere between the Subaru Impreza and the BMW 530. I'd like a nice cabin. I'd like good handling (subjective, but "like a Subaru or BMW or Toyota, not like a Nissan"). I'd like something 2017 or newer. I'd like no more than 35,000 miles. I'd like to keep the price under $30K, and if possible lower.

Any counsel?

Hello, so I'm looking for a vehicle. My history includes: Toyota Rav4, Pontiac G6 (not a fan), Jeep Grand Cherokee, and a Jeep Compass. I obviously prefer bigger cars, with space to carry things. 

Only things I ask for, in no particular order

1. Fuel efficiency in these crazy times.
2. Spacious
3. Nothing that looks like a square (like the Jeep Patriot)
4. Nothing electric
5. Nothing with expensive parts if repairs/replacements are ever needed

Hope that's enough to get started.

Best.

Hello everyone, we have a 2010 Acura TSX with some minor wheel well damage from where someone backed into us. We're also in the market for a new vehicle. My question is, should we take the few grand that the insurance company gave us to fix it and take it to a body shop to fix, or sell it as is and pocket the insurance money? Other things about the car, it's got 160,000 miles, some trim issues, minor oil consumption issue, crack windshield, and a weird grinding noise at startup that the dealership said it's a non-issue.
-------------------------------

Just curious, how reliable are these cars (either engine). Are parts easy to come by, are the parts cheap? Hows insurance on these car? Anything helps

Is this a good deal? The price includes everything, certified with warranty for 36 days, fully customized with black rims and tinted windows. It has 170k km on it and its just missing the passenger side handle with a few dents on that side. No accident history or anything on it. The car looks really nice but I dont know if the price is worth it. It also takes premium gas.

Hiiii, 

I would like some expert advice on which car to get. As I love to do road trips, I would like one with good engine, and the tyres are alloys. I would also like to save on fuel as well. Please give me some advice on which of the two would be best.

Hi, I'm asking on behalf of my Mum. She's currently looking after my elderly grandparents, one of which falls whenever she's not holding onto someone else and the other had a stroke a few years ago and now isn't able to move as freely as he once could. 

We know she needs a taller car than she already has (currently drives a Corsa D)so they can get in an out more easily/without being literally pulled out of the car. And it needs to have enough boot space for at least one wheelchair possibly two. 

I initially suggested a Skoda Yeti but that isn't chic enough. We narrowed down the selection to the Hyundai ix35, the Nissan Qashqui and the Kia Sportage. 

Were looking at 10k budget for a sub 8year old car.

What would you buy if you were in these circumstances?

Hey yall! Im 19 and I just got my license. Been terrified to drive for ages but since I need it for travel purposes I decided to suck it up. Now I need to find one to save up for. Im looking for something around the ballpark of 5,000 since Ive heard thats a good starter price. Furthermore, Id like something safe first and foremost. Im only comfortable taking backroads at least for now, but I still have that fear of getting in a wreck, so having something that I can be confident I wont immediately be game overd in would be great. Other than that just the basic good things to look for in a car. Im not too knowledgeable on cars but I know mileage should be good and all that. 

Heres the issue. Back when I was a younger teenager I was DEAD SET on getting either a van (which i know now is exorbitantly priced), or a 80s/90s station wagon. I looked at some station wagons from that time and found some reasonably priced ones, but looking at the cars they looked not the safest. Are these even safe at all? If not, whats a good alternative? Thanks so much.

India is still fledgling in the electric vehicle segment. The electric vehicle market is full of potential for growth and expansion both nationally and internationally. Tata Motors is one of our countrys leading automakers and is currently leading the electric vehicle segment in India.

Tata launched Tigor EV and Nexon EV in 2019 followed by the [***Nexon EV Max in 2022.***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvcij1Ga-Gw&amp;t=6s) The company has also announced a number of concepts in recent years. The production units of these concepts are highly awaited by Indian buyers.

The company has also announced the launch of 5-10 more new electric vehicles in the next few years.

Here is the list of Top 5 Upcoming Tata's Electric Cars!

I commute 90 miles round trip for work ( I am looking for a closer job) should I sell the mini Cooper ( 2010 6-speed, kept up on all maintenance, new clutch as well) and buy a used prius? The Mini is a lot of fun but expensive to repair. I can't really afford a car payment but could spend about 8,000 on a new to me car. 
Right now gas for work and back is 90-100 dollars a week, with a prius it would be about 65-70.

Opinions welcome, I like that the Corolla has paddle shifters while the Kia does not, slightly better MPGs and Toyota reliability. All categories are pretty close but the Kia looks nicer in my opinion. With that said, does anyone know of a better leasing/financing option or any deals that would make one a significantly better value over the other? Anyone test or drive both, thoughts? Thank you in advance!

In current market I cant understand why buying a used car instead a new one is better deal. Carmax sells Toyota Corolla 2018 with 100k miles for $19k and brand new Toyota Corolla 2022 starts $20.4k
Could somebody explain why to buy used?

New Veloster N was $42k after taxes
Opted for a used one 
2020 VN 20k miles

30,987(base price)
1,000(USED RECON FEE)
979(taxable fees)
250(Admin fee)
1778(Tax)
207(tag)
35200

When trying to negotiate they barely budged as its a rare car with a new one being $33k, $5k markup and $4k in taxes and fees.

Car also had $2.2k of upgrades.

Seems like every dealer I tried buying this car from are around the same on taxes and fees or have an insane markup. Is this normal for this market now.

I recently bought a fiat 500 Abarth. It was a fun car with some nice pep, but after my mechanic did the pre purchase inspection they do, I realized I had to send it back. Id like a sporty, little car like a Miata or the Abarth I was just teased with.

Not sure if this is really even a comparison considering the differing prices but still wanted to get some opinions.

1. 2001 Honda Accord ($3500)

* Rebuilt transmission, replaced (?) engine with 90k km on it (body has 320k), new brake pads + rotors, new muffler, changed fuel pump, aftermarket rims + snow set, 4-1 aftermarket headers, leather interior, heated seats, ac, sunroof, clean body, no accidents
* Problems found online were about the transmission but maybe that has been addressed from the rebuilt transmission?

2. 2007 Toyota Camry CE ($1500)

* 101k engine, serviced in time, clean body, no accidents, safety certification
* Problems found online were about the oil burning problem with the 2AZ-FE engine (which this car has)

It will be my first car, mainly looking for a car to just get to places with as little maintenance as possible (although some of the easy stuff like oil changes will be fine if necessary), I can send pictures too if it helps.

Im going off to college soon and to say the least weve had a stressful journey trying to find a car for me. As of now, all  Im really looking for is a sedan/hatchback from around 2014 that is reliable, practical, and is good on gas (around 25 mpg city or higher). Style and how fun it is to drive is always a good factor in this, but because of the car market thats something that I would still like, but dont need. We are buying from a used car dealer, and cars come and go really quickly. Is there anything I should look out for?

Looking to buy a new suv for our growing family and want something reliable. The 19 Santa Fe SE with 32k miles is at car max, from Ohio so a little worried about road salt rust but it has a solid clean car fax one owner etc its priced a little over $26k. A new Hyundai Santa Fe SEL at a dealer near me is pricing them at MSRP its about $31k (with the add ons theyve added) and they have a $500 discount I qualify for. But I also just found out about Mazdas, I dont know much about them but the cx-5 seems really nice the select near me is priced at $29k msrp but I havent yet reached out to see what the add ons are that Im sure theyve added will make it but Im guessing it will be roughly the same as the new Santa Fe price. Which would you choose and why? Also looking for the lowest monthly payment we can get but if its not much different to buy new should I just pull the plug and pay the extra $50 or whatever to get a new one?
Thanks

Right now Im looking at 2 cars. I already have a daily drive so Im not worried about that. This car is more for fun and to work on with my friends.

The first car is a 1993 mr2. It has the naturally aspirated 2.2l engine. It has 150k miles however I would eventually engine swap it to something like a k series. Its also a manual. The main issue is that it has a rebuilt title, however the owner claims that it was from hail damage and that everything has been fixed. Overall it looks pretty clean, it also has a sunroof. It has a tiny rust patch on the rear quarter panel above the mold strip.

The second car is a 1990 750il. It has the V12 engine, however an automatic transmission. It also has 95k miles. It seems like more of a project since it has a couple more issues such as running rich, needs exhaust and suspension work, however Id prolly change those anyways. It also says the transmission is leaky and slips a bit.

I know I didnt give that many details or anything, so if you have any questions please ask.

I've been eyeing a 1986 Toyota Cressida going for 6k with 115k miles. The interior and exterior of the car look pristine (from the photos) and apparently it runs and drives well? Is it worth considering or is it a bad idea because the car isn't as common of a model and maintenance/sourcing replacement parts could be tough? Is a car this old prone to turning into a paperweight? I could afford something more expensive but I'd prefer to save some money and I've become terribly bored of the 2010 accord I share with a family member so I really don't want a basic normal car. Something about a simple old car just appeals to me for some reason but if that sounds dumb please snap me out of it. Thought this might be a fun quirky car to drive.

As title says, my budget is 75k for a car - theres a 2019 RS5 for sale @ 70k near me with 13k miles and its the color I want and specd out exactly how Id want.

On the other hand, if I wait a little, I can get a new S5 at the same price if not less, but I do need a car relatively soon (within a month) so I cant wait too long.

My heart wants the RS5 but my brain says get an S5. Ive heard good and bad things about the newer Audis (2020+ refresh).

I want to hear everyones inputs!

If you read the title of this, you know my budget. However, I could go up to $28k, but $25k and under would be best for me.

I want something that will used/new, will be great on fuel and will be reliable in winter because our winters get pretty wicked. I'd also like to go off-roading with it because why not. What should I get?

Sorry if this is too personal, I don't have anyone around me that can give me advice on this. A little bit about me. I am 25 years old, I have been wanting to buy my own car for the longest time. Financially I can afford something that's around $35k but is it but is it a bad idea? I want to buy a hybrid/plug-in hybrid/electric and looking at models like hyundai elantra hybrid, honda accord hybrid, BMW 330, tesla. Looking towards electric because I have solar panels at home and it generates more electricity than I can use in a lifetime.  Currently I drive a paid off 2009 Acura rdx which is a hand-me-down from my father. It has been kept well condition and has about 90k miles. I understand that I can probably drive another 50k more tbh and SUVs are more comfortable and better overall but I am not at the point in my life where I want a family car... Its not my style and doesn't feel like my car. I want a sedan/coupe that can burn asphalt you know? something that's sporty and impresses the lady. Should I even buy a car or should I just keep driving my current car until it dies? Am I just being childish? Should I just suck it up and save my money? Has anyone been in the same situation before?

Their current car is on its last legs and we're trying to find something cheap and reliable. We've tried all the usual cars; so far the Camry, Corolla, Accord, Civic, Passat, Jetta, Mazda 6, Mazda 3, Optima, Forte, Sonata, Elantra, and a couple others. The selection is slim though, and of these models, the majority around $5K are 270k+ km and many are rebuilt titles. 

We also briefly looked into a couple hatches (namely the Golf, Matrix, and Yaris) but these are proving both rare and pricy. We're pretty open to almost any style and make, with the only exception being pickups. 

We're wondering if we should be open to higher mileage, and if so, how high? Also, are there any "hidden gems" that we might've missed. Thank you for the help!

Just curious, how reliable are these cars (either engine). Are parts easy to come by, are the parts cheap? Hows insurance on these car? Anything helps

I currently have a 2021 Honda Accord Sport 1.5- that I absolutely hate. Maybe hates a strong word- the thing that bugs me most is the road noise when driving on freeways- if Im on the phone and on the freeway it literally sounds like Im in a rocket ship taking off. 
Im considering trading it in a for a Mazda CX-5, but Im not sure if Im just being dramatic. 
Im wanting some features that the Honda doesnt have (wireless Apple CarPlay, sunroof, wireless charging)

Is it a good trade? Or should I just keep my Honda and suck it up?

I am concerned about the battery breaking because it's a 6 year old hybrid but the reliability and comfort and fuel economy should make it worth it right? Looking for a jack of all trades for all those factors. I'm also considering cars like a Mazda 6 or Camry.

My friend got a new car and since I don't have a car and am looking to get one he offered to sell me his old car for 8k. He says that it needs a new power steering pump and that sometimes the airbag light comes on he says you can reset it if it comes on again.

2015 Mazda CX-5, 155k miles, 20 service records, $11k.

2010 RAV4, 133k miles, 18 service records, $9.2k.

My main concern is reliability. I don't plan on driving it much (~3k a year) but I hope to keep it for a while 5+ years.  Which car should I get?

I posted earlier in this sub with questions about crossovers, but ended up after some reflection determining I don't need that much space and am broadening my search. I was looking into buying a new Mazda3 Hatchback or Corolla Hatchback if I could find them at MSRP, and I am pre-approved for a $22k loan from my bank, plus $10k cash available for this and a trade in with maybe $2-4k. Recently a family friend has offered me their 2014 Prius C One with 44k miles for $14k. It has "light hale damage" and a small dent in the door... I saw pictures and these things don't seem so visible. Having the gas mileage of a Prius at this time would be really nice, but I was wondering if this was a good price? It seems to be $3-4k below market but there isn't that many on the market right now to really tell. Or anything I should look out for in this model? Thanks for the help!

After 3 years ownership of jaguar xf , want to get a car which may give me excitement.

I know cayenne is unrelated between those 3 but I always wanted a bigger SUV even I know it will be boring to drive.

Z4, 3.0 engine can easily tune to get 400 hp and hard top, you can use both as Cabrio or coupe sports car. Better performance than cayman.

Cayman looks better, and gets better attention but slower than Z4. But probably handles better than Z4.

How realistic is it to finance with a job offer at a dealership? A local one, not ford, Nissan, etc. I graduated college recently and have no income. However, my incoming job is more than enough to afford it. Would making a down payment of a certain percentage help me? Thank you

Hello Folks, looking to buy RAV4 2022 XLE Hybrid, called dealer as noob first time buyer, got to knew that new one not coming anytime sooner can't even pre-book. Two options he suggested:
1) Go with 2018 model they have in great condition, price CA$39K+ tax, under 30K mileage. just crazy price overall used cars market (just discovered) almost same price as of new one.
2) Go with leasing option instead of financing, they have 2022 model in SE AWD on GAS (non-hybrid), further details about lease plan would be discussed during in-store visit. He said get on lease, use it for 2-3 yrs and then come back to us for an exchange. 

Now I am totally noob into it just got my license, wonder should I check other dealers or private outlets kijiji, FB, Autotraders.ca etc? Also in above two options, which one sounds good? Used price market is so crazy hence wanted to go with new one but can't get the new one. Leasing vs Financing no idea. 

I can't hold off further as of family needs.

Please advice, thanks in advance!

More of a "should I sell" question, but I'm hoping you can steer my thoughts in the right direction.

I have a 2015 BRZ with 29k miles that I almost never drive. When I do drive, I take our other car (2018 Kia Niro) 99% of the time, because I'm usually just doing a short commute to daycare and I need a real backseat for the kid's carseat.

Both me and my wife work from home, although she has to go into the office in DC (20-30min drive) maybe 4-5 days a month. That would leave me without a car during the day if she has to stay late, so I would not be able to pick up the kid without a backup car. 

 It feels inefficient to have a car I almost never use sitting in the driveway waiting to depreciate. With the market the way it is, I could sell the BRZ to KBB/CarMax for what I paid for it 5 years ago or get a small profit selling it privately. It's tempting to sell it and get something as cheap as possible that is safe/reliable enough to do the shuttle from daycare and back on those days when the Niro isn't available. 

An older EV like a 2011/2012/2013 Leaf sounds cool since I wouldn't need to have a long-range for what I would be using it for, and there would certainly be plenty of time to charge in the driveway. I could also live with an old reliable Honda/Toyota. Of course, those prices are also inflated too. I don't know if leasing for a year and hoping the market settles makes any sense.

I might also just be thinking about this the wrong way, and maybe I should just keep the BRZ even though I barely use it. Do you guys have any thoughts?

Should I buy a 2002 Toyota Sienna for 5,250?  149,000 miles, but the orto (similar to car fax ) says mileage issues.  

Have an Innova 5160 OBD to check out the mileage discrepancy and any codes.  

Has been taken care of by chain mechanic stores, so not so great.  

Don't know how many owners yet.

I have never bought a car. I just graduated college and have been saving for a few years to buy a newer car. My parents have never bought a car from a dealership before. Im not sure what to look for when shopping or what is a good deal. Is $13,650 a bad deal for a 2014 Toyota Corolla with 106k miles? Theres no reported accidents or repairs and its only ever had 1 owner. I really appreciate any help!

Complete and running/driving Tercel. 65k miles - in storage since 1991. All glass, interior ok. Almost no rust. *hood a bit crumpled in front from deer strike, also hand painted with a big stupid peace sign, grill missing* but headlights, radiator, etc. undamaged.

Seller inherited it, and local mechanic has replaced critical stuff (the old tires seem to be holding air) to make it drivable. They are asking $4K. What do you guys think? Is that a good price? Does anyone collect these?

I've had a BMW M3, G80 generation, for just about half a year and while I love the car when I'm pushing it, as a daily driver it's... a lot. Sometimes I just want it to feel like a normal car and not compromised for performance. The ride and twitchiness of it even in comfort mode can be exhausting. The level of luxury in the interior is great (have all the options + full leather ticked for the interior), so ideally want to keep that level. Oh, and something not as conspicuous where I don't try to get raced twice a month. Yes, I thought people were making up stories but it happens more than I want. 

With a budget of up to $80k, ideally $70k, I'm hoping to maintain some of the thrust of the powertrain with a car that can be dialed up to similar, but not exact, levels of performance. And with my daily commute I'd love a PHEV. The V60 Polestar comes to mind as a sensible middle ground, but I'm not opposed to SUVs either.

And if any of you have downgraded from a car like that to something more sensible and regretted it let me know!

Hey all, I'm looking for compact SUV in the 20s/early 30s range and these two are available to me nearby. 

The goal is to have something that gets daily errands done but can also power through an occasional trip on the highway. Im a car novice but I did give an older CX 30 a test drive and it felt a bit rocky to me. The Hyundai works out to a few thousand cheaper and having wireless Android auto plus what felt like more advanced tech with the driving assistance and dashboard actually made me feel more positive about the Hyundai than the CX30, even though I recognize this is a mid trim and not as professional as the CX 30 on paper.

Any thoughts?

Checking out a 2008 Saturn Vue V6 with 86,000km. Previously owned one and loved it and now need a vehicle to putter around the city and a couple long distance trips a year. With the low mileage will it be ok or will it start to break down simply because it's 14 years old. This will be my first used car after always buying new. Any advice or insight appreciated!
-------------------------------

I checked out this car earlier today - 2008 Pilot SE FWD, 170k miles, very clean condition. Asking price of $6,400 and it has been on FB marketplace for about 6 days now.

Car looks very clean and well taken care of. Carfax shows pretty regular service appointments other than one (of 4) owners who had the car for about 40k miles (I'm guessing they maintained the car but obviously don't know). In the last 50k miles the major(ish) things that have been replaced/fixed have been front struts, lower control arms, water pump, timing belt, new tires 10k miles ago, and new radiator.

I like the car but the price seems a little high, but I'm not sure if that's just the market now. Seller was nice but wouldn't budge a dollar on price (I offered $5,500). Thoughts?

Hello, currently I am driving a bare bones RWD 2005 F-150 as my daily and I am restoring a 1987 RX-7, and was looking at options to replace the Ford. I live in New Jersey and need something that is blizzard capable, but I hate trucks. I've done some surface level researcg on a short list of WRXs, Evos, Focuses, etc, and still unsure of what would fit me best. Here is my list of things I either need or want with the car.

Budget is currently open ended, my focus currently is restoring my 7 and replacing the truck is for the future, so I'll save as much as necessary for what I end up liking. Anything above 15-20k is where I'd rather look at new, only really comfortable taking a loan and spending that much as the first owner.

4 Door Sedan/Hatch (need)
AWD system that will handle snow easily (need)
Enough power to be fun and throw around in the snow, but still expecting decent fuel economy (20mpg city min)
Physical radio and climate controls rather than an infotainment screen (want, will settle if newer cars are exceptionally worth getting over older ones)

No other real requirements that I can think of right now, will add to the list if something comes to mind.

Im 21 not sure if I should sell my 2007 Toyota solara. It has 135k miles and even though mechanically everything is perfect, it has several cosmetic issues. Cover is broken off of my left mirror, missing one fog light, dented in the bumper and on the left side door. Found the rav4 with 67,000 miles selling for 14,000. The car looked like it had no scratches, no dents, and was totally clean and near perfect looking on the inside. Im not sure if its worth it to keep my current car or to buy a new one with current car prices. Ill be done with college in a year so I dont know if I should wait until then to see if I can get something nicer.

Long story short, I sold my car and got more than what I paid for it. I put in an order for another car but I dont expect to have that car for 4-6 months. 



Is there any car I can buy for ~$5000 or less that can still be sold for the same amount in 6-12 months?



I work from home so this is really just a grocery getter and errand runner.

I had picked up a 2WD Tacoma and regretted it due to the fact I had gotten a 5 lug base model.

I sold it for 13K, and currently have my bike, and motorcycle for transport. Im looking to spend at most 7K, but all I care about is travel, bikes, and fun.

Im simply looking for something reliable, easy and (as fun as it can be) to work on.

I fell in love with my 07 Corolla as my first car, and want a second love.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Obviously Honda civic and Toyota Corolla are the correct answers for this, BUT they are also expensive AND they have higher purchase prices and higher insurance rates (I am in Toronto, Canada). 



So what other cars are basically very close competitors, that are cheaper to buy (NOT very mandatory) but definitely have cheaper insurance rates (mandatory)


I am going to be buying a car that is 2013-2020 (obviously the newer the better)


I'm open to all options but I know that these cars are usually very good: Kia, Hyundai, Subaru, Mazda, Honda, Toyota
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
So right now Im driving a paid off 04 Silverado with 260k miles with a junky AC

I need a new ride thats safe for my newborn, but also not going to break the bank. Id love to get into a Tacoma base for under 32 but that seems impossible after doing some shopping. So right now Im looking at some cars/ SUVs for under 28-30ish with a few exceptions. I just need some insight

2022 Kia Forte GT Manual. Is this a safe car. It interest me because theres a few new that are available in my area so I can get into to it asap plus the options for the MSRP are great. Just unsure on reliability. 

2022 WRX Base manual - I can put a deposit on this but its 35k after TTL and it has an added short throw shifter. Is breaking my budget by 5k really worth for this vehicle?
-------------------------------

I really want the civic coupe sport but it only comes with a 2.0 NA 158HP engine, while the hatch sport comes with a 1.5T 176HP engine. The upside of getting the coupe is that it has built in CarPlay while the hatch doesnt. On the other hand, the 3rd gen Mazda 3 hatch comes with better premium interior qualities for a similar price range. The downside is that since its a 3rd gen, it doesnt have built in CarPlay, although, I hear you can take it to the dealer to get it installed for a few hundred bucks.

Im seeking advice on a car that has decent tow capability and gas mileage without killing my monthly budget. 
The situation is this: I need my car for my daily commute (70 km mainly hway) that can safely tow 1 ton trailer for my side hustle and some off-road capability for when I go camping. It crossed my mind a truck can come more handy but is more expensive and With this gas prices I dont thinks will be a good idea. 
I flip furniture, movings , furniture delivery, pressure washing, junk removal,etc. 

Ive been offered the Chevy equinox 2018 with 70.000 km and a ford scape same year. 

Any thoughts about this models or any others that could work?

Went to Honda and Toyota dealerships, prices seemed insane after market price adjustments, so I need some recommendations.

I dont need many features just a rear view camera, and some decent safety features. Itd be cool if I could get a sunroof possibly or push to start but not a necessity. All in all trying to stay below 30k after market adjustments and fees but willing to push a little higher if its REALLY worth it.

Tied between two cars to get. I don't know which one I should look at first. I'm looking for something fun and sporty and those two were in my price range. Which one should I check out first, or which one would be best?

1996 Ford Mustang Convertible-
$3k
100k miles
Manual
Needs no major work
Has minor upgrades (exhaust, suspension)
Paint looks good, red
Top looks slightly rough, doesn't leak
160hp


1999 Pontiac Firebird Convertible-
$2.5k
163k miles
Minor upgrades (exhaust, touchscreen radio)
Needs wheel bearing and steering column replaced
Auto 
200hp
Paint also looks good, dark blue
Top looks good


I'm really leaning towards the Firebird, but I also want to check out the vehicle that is better, first. So I need you guys advice and opinions!

My gf and I are going off to college and looking to buy a car to make transportation convenient. Our budget is $25K and weve been looking at some cars like the Elantra, Civic and Sentra. Of the 3 weve narrowed it down to, we both like the Sentra the most but were nervous about Nissans CVT issues and it has been shying us away from the Sentra, although its the most compelling for us. Should we pull the trigger on it anyways? If not, recommend some cars for us!

Hi All,

I was looking into the idea of trading in my 2016 Lexus IS 350 with 32K miles for around $31K (I bought it used for $30.5K in 2020) for a new 2022 Camry SE (roughly $31K after taxes and fees). I'll be required to drive to the office five days a week starting July after mainly teleworking since COVID hit. It would be around 50 miles round trip and probably around 10-12K miles a year. For me, I enjoy the luxury feel of the IS but with gas prices these days and the high resale value, I was wondering if it was worth the gas savings and other related cost (maintenance, taxes, insurance) to trade it in for a Camry? I appreciate the input in advance. Thanks!

I am looking buy a car I live around Biloxi Mississippi and am willing to drive 3 hours or so for the right car.

&amp;#x200B;

I want upper 30s or 40 MPG, I absolutely prefer hatchbacks. I am looking for something with 30k or less miles and I want to pay around 20K before tax. So far I am really leaning to the Honda Fit I drove one in my area and definitely liked it. (I am coming from a 2012 Mazda 2)

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, The Honda Fit I drove was a 2015. I was driving it to just get a feel for the car not because I was particularly interested in that car. But my question is the one I am really looking at is a 2019 has the driving experience been improved any sense then? Because I was pretty satisfied with the 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked into a Kia Rio, Kia Soul, Ford Fiesta, Chevy Cruze, Chevy Spark, Chevy Sonic and Chevy Trax. Is there maybe anything I am overlooking?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want a car that will last me years without throwing many problems my direction, that has a good amount of useful cargo space and gets great MPGs. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions let me know.

I am a college student. I want to buy a car that will last into my early career for commuting and weekend getaways. I prioritize reliability, economy, and practicality. I am biased towards Honda and Toyota, though I am keeping Mazda, 2012+ Subaru, and Ford Hybrids in the running. I like hatchbacks and wagons over sedans and SUVs.

I am looking at toyota Priuses and corrollas/matrix as well as honda fit/civics. I like the idea of getting a manual car or a hybrid for my first car. My budget is 10k so I am shopping mostly in the 2010-2014 model year range. Anyone have any advice or strong suggestions on a model i may have overlooked?

Hi guys currently looking at second cars my current car is a Ford Fiesta Mk7 diesel 110,800 miles, 2009. Can feel it going to give up soon and dont trust it doing long drives, I know diesels are made for it but the wear on the car when going far is what worries me. Im looking for a little bit faster and more reliable. I have been looking at Ford Fiesta ecoboost with less miles and newer, however is coming about 8k was wondering if anyone has any suggestions around 4-6k whats reliable new and little bit faster than my current car. Appreciate any help thanks

We currently have a hatchback that's great but it's on the small side and we're looking to get a bit of a bigger car as we'll have two kids here shortly. 

Would love to go full electric, but as this will be our main car, I was mainly comparing the Escape PHEV and the Rav4 PHEV. After reading the reviews and everything, even though the Rav4 is a nicer car, decided to go with the Escape.  We went and test drove and then ordered one that they said will be here in 3 months-ish. Went with the PHEV based on the tax rebates making it cheaper than the hybrid and around $33.5k.

We don't have a huge list of must haves and the ones we do could be covered by a lot of vehicles so I'm now thinking that maybe I didn't consider all our options for the 40k. Is there anything out there that you would recommend in the 40k range that tics the following options:

What we're looking for:

* Crossover/SUV/wagon that can easily hold 2 car seats and is relatively easy to get the kids in and out
* Good amount of storage even with 2 car seats in place
* A/C vents for the back seats
* Heated seats
* Front wheel or all wheel drive 
* Apple CarPlay and Android Auto
* Good gas mileage, ideally 40+
* Good safety ratings

Hi, Im looking for some car buying advice like the title says. Ive recently gotten a new job which requires me to travel quite a distance. 

Im looking at going for an electric car / PHEV but I need something with good range if electric only as I will be traveling ~131 miles at times. 

Any suggestions for anything ~450 a month or less will be much appreciated

Thanks

To preface, I love electric cars as well as good old stick shifts. Then again, I found out that 2021 Chevy Bolts have crazy incentives on them making them come close to the low $20k range. Im not sure if its a good idea to do this because I know you shouldnt ever buy a car because of gas prices but this car is getting a brand new battery pack (Chevy Bolt recall) and my car is worth a lot even with 66k miles on it so Im wondering if I should just trade in my car for a Bolt. I have a level 2 charger at home and most of my trips are less than 200 miles so theres that. I also drove a bolt back in 2020 and it was fun but obviously not a stick shift Civic. What should I do?

Hello everyone,

I've been looking at Mustangs for a few months now, and to preface, I've wanted one of these ever since I was a child. 

I just finished school and make 65k, I have no bills at the moment (just moved back home from college) and around 3k to put for a down payment on a new car. My old Saturn Astra just died so I've been borrowing my GF's Chevy Cruze for awhile, I work from home so it isn't the end of the world, but it definitely sucks not having a car whenever I need it and she's at work or busy.

There are a few brand new Mustang offerings near me that seem to be fairly priced. As far as I can tell, the 2022s at the dealerships around me are being sold at MSRP, which seems good considering how things have been. The one that I'm specifically eyeing is a 2022 EcoBoost Fastback with the only features being an automatic trans and the black accent package, bringing it to around 31.6k MSRP. I have access to the recent grad discount and a ford employee discount, bringing the total to about 28.7k. I've been quoted at 4% interest on a 60 month financing term, meaning the payment would be \~$511 a month. 

Does this seem reasonable for somebody in my position? I'm contributing to my 401k up to my employer's match and I have some savings built up, and I'm also guaranteed a raise to 70k in August. Currently I take home about \~$3900 after taxes/insurance, and I live a pretty frugal lifestyle (total expenses are around $500/mo). I do plan on moving into an apartment in the near future, but rent around me is cheap (750$-1000$/mo) as I live in a very LCOL area (Michigan). To me, it seems like I could afford it, even if it isn't the smartest purchase, but I know all of the financial gurus would frown upon me taking a loan out for a car, especially a brand new one at that.

What do you guys think? I'm obviously aware of the current market situation, but to me this doesn't seem like as bad of a deal as buying something used would be right now, because at least I'm getting a brand new car (one that I've wanted for literally my entire life!), and not some beater with a ton of miles on it for $20k.

Hello, about a month ago my 06 S197 GT was totaled by a distracted driver. Basically drove directly into me on a residential street. Was able to bargain with their insurance to write me a check instead of trying to fix it. I wasnt going to  have them perform shotty work on it. 63k miles, no prior accidents and a paint correction performed on it, I was heartbroken by the chain of events that occurred because I was planning on keeping it for a long time. But in the end I got a check of around 16k so I started looking. A month later and no stangs of similar condition available, Im pretty much lost on what to get. Still want a fun v8 or v6 but also has the reliability that my mustang had. Would really appreciate it if someone could give me suggestions!

Hiyo! New here!

I am 25 years old and am finally getting my driver's licence! Well overdue but this means I'm new to the car market. 

I'm looking at some vehicles from CarMax (I have already made up my mind that I will be buying though them) but am hesitant of the car lasting the duration of my 60-month loan. Anything with under 100K miles is either out of budget (over $18K) or an econobox death trap I've been warned to not buy (Mitsubishi Mirages, Nissan Versas, Chevy Cruzes, etc). It's likely I will have to buy something in that 90K-120K range. 

My question is: if I bought a vehicle in this range, would it last me the 60 months? I know vehicles nowadays last longer than they used to, but my partner's 2012 Subaru Crosstrek got economically totalled at 159K miles (purchased from a Subaru dealership) and Subarus are supposedly supposed to last 200K+ miles.

The vehicles I'm looking at (they are all $15K flat, fees
 2014 Kia Soul +, 101K miles
 2014 Toyota Camry SE, 112K miles
 2013 Honda Fit Sport, 116K miles
 2014 Subaru Impreza, 108K miles
 2013 Mazda3 | Sport, 90K miles

It's worth noting that I live close to the city and commute by transit, so I estimated that I drive only an average of 6000 miles per year. In other words, I only need the vehicle to last me 30K miles or so, though longer would be nice. 

Are any of these vehicles reliable enough to endure 30K miles or 5 years? If so, which is the most economical choice of these given options?

Many thanks in advance! :)

As the title states, Im debating on selling my 2009 Honda Accord Coupe. I bought him fresh off the lot in at 8 miles and he has served me well over the past 13 years. Since then, my family has expanded and the leg room in the back seat has become troublesome for growing kids. Also, the floods during rainy season (SoFLo) has gotten worse over the years and Im afraid Im going to stall out one of these days. Im thinking of trading it in for something bigger or keeping it for my soon to be driver kid. With that, I have been looking around for something sporty thats good on gas, has backseat legroom, possibly a high ground clearance and less than $25k. Im open to a new/used sedan, wagon, or crossover. Im not opposed to an SUV or minivan but theyre not my first choices. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Someone ran a stop sign, hit me (27F), and totaled my 2014 Ford Escape SE (2WD). It had 99,000 miles on it. It was paid off. My insurance is being pretty horrible and ghosted me. The auto body shop where my car is at told me they are gonna total it. 

In the meantime, Im thinking about my next car. I want a reliable car. Im willing to spend 15-20k (financing). I have no idea what to get. I like fords because they are reliable(always have been for me). I like Chevy trucks lol. Im too embarrassed to say my dream truck lol (think most hated).

Im attracted to lower mileage, reliability, and safety. My escape was perfect (Im heartbroken).

I generally dont care what people think but people are joking on me for looking at kias. At first I hated kias but now Im interested. I used to hate mini coopers now I like them. 

I like small SUVs or trucks cause I dont feel safe in a sedan. I like old station wagons but dont wanna get an older car that might bankrupt me. Ill wait for my 30s for that. 

Part of me is tempted to not buy a new car until the market changes, but will it ever? I live in a walkable city and have humbled myself the last month without a car. Maybe I could save some money and plan to get a car next year. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

Im looking to purchase a study 4wd car for the winters of Montana. This listing is asking for $7k for the Bronco and it looks in pretty great condition, everything been fixed up. I want to offer $5k since it only gets 16 mpg (luckily I dont need to drive toooo far). Does anyone who knows about ford and/or broncos think this investment is worth it? Ill be checking it out on Sunday, so I can update then!

Im getting a good price on a Camry thats had moderate damage to the rear reported on Carfax early in its lifespan. But after that it was sold by Toyota as Cerfified Pre-Owned. To me that indicates that the damage couldnt have been functionally serious, or was fully repaired? I will have an independent mechanic check it out first but was wondering if this is necessarily a deal breaker or how you would view it

Im looking at buying a 2006 Saab 93. It has 158k miles on it, and no mechanical issues other than a broken fuel gauge. The car has no rust on it, and the bodys in great condition. Its a combi with the 2.0t engine.
It has steering wheel controls, the cd changer radio, wood dash trim, leather seats, and 2 owners. Theres also maintenance records going back to 2009 and a recent oil change/strut replacement.
The seller is asking $3500. Is this too much or a great deal? What are these cars worth?

Hello! Basically I found a really good deal on a car. However, its 9500 and I only have about 8700 in my savings to buy a car. I dont want to take out a loan, so would offering 8500 be too big of a jump? Also, any tips on how to start the conversation of negotiating? Thanks!

Let's assume someone asks for a entry level sedan but above the base level stuff. 4 door, fwd, auto

Mazda 3 2.5 starts at $22,100 with 186hp and 186 tq. It has 28mpg combined, 25 city, 33 highway

Honda civic 2.0 starts at $22,500 with 158hp and 138tq. It gets 35mpg combined , 35 city, 40 highway.

Honda civic 1.5t starts at $25,550 with 180hp and 177tq. It gets 36 combined, 33 city, 36 highway


At the same price the civic has less hp and way less tw and the auto is a cvt, however the mpg is better by a decent amount. If you want the match the power of the mazda you get close with the civix ex but pay 3k more, still better gas milage though.

But there's a bit more. The mazda auto is a torque converter and is NA. That's one less failure and the torque converter is also a known tech. 

You can get the less powerful civic that is NA but you still get a cvt.

Isn't the mazda 3 the best choice?

Making this for a sanity check. I have been thinking of "downgrading" to a VW Golf R. Before this car I had a 2017 VW Golf R. I sold it to my brother and he still drives to this day. So I still see it and drive it from time to time. I loved that car and if he didn't beg me to give it to him I would still probably be driving to this day. 

I bought the Audi because I could afford it and to be frank I have not owned a sporty luxury car before. The car is great, but every time I drive it I feel something is missing and what's frustrating is that I can't figure what it is. But every time I am driving the Golf I am not feeling that despite being an inferior car in many ways. I will also save money in the process if I switch. Anyone has considered both cars?

Hey guys, I'm new to posting on reddit so excuse me if I'm being a bit informal.

Recently I have bought a new Rx-8 with a wing that the previous owner has put on it. It looks pretty cool, but I would also like it to make a difference, even if it is a small one. Now I don't know much about spoilers and wings, so I figured you guys could help me out here. The previous owner says that it is made out of carbon fiber, and that he has hand bolted it to the car. That is all good, and he did a pretty good job ngl, but he also said that he got it from E-bay, which has left me worried that this is one of those "one size fits all" scams. My question is, does this actually make a difference in downforce? Is it actually helpful or just a junk strapped to my car? Please help me!

&amp;#x200B;

Thx in advance! :)

Im looking at two used cars: a 2020 XC60 T5 Momentum w/ 9480 miles at $42k, and a 2020 V60 CC T5 wagon w/ 12750 miles at $43k. 

Ive been reading about some owners thoughts around things like the infotainment being a bit slow as a big QOL complaint. But from a reliability perspective, with the mileage there would there be any sort of repairs/reliability issues to be aware of if owning the car for ~4-5 years at ~4000 miles a year driving?

Hi 

Im looking to buy my first car to drive in Los Angeles, Im open to both new and used cars. I will be commuting everyday for work but at the same time I want a sporty car that provides a fun driving experience if I ever want to go for a drive. 

Currently I have been looking into used Alfa Romeo stelvio, Giulia, Audi s3 (I think s3 hit all the box for luxury, comfort, and speed ). I would really want a Mazda Miata but not sure if practicality will drive me crazy. So Im open to recommendation and just overall what should I really look into when buying my first car since Im not sure how important is it to really have a big trunk space etc.

I have looked into ev cars but it seem theres too high of a demand on them where its really difficult to get for msrp new and just overall is crossover of suv and sedan for around 50k
-------------------------------

Im thinking of purchasing a 2011 Scion xB, manual, 196,000kms, priced at 7k CAD.

Personally I think its a bit overpriced, however its in great condition, and Im looking for a car to use as a reliable and decent on gas daily. Anyone know anything that I should look out for on this car? Also if theres any other recommendations with similar size and interior space please make a recommendation!

We are looking for our first nicer car since we have a 2.5 year old toddler now.  At the Lexus dealership we were looking at a 2016 Lexus NX 200t.  I'm looking for some advice on if this is good/bad/ok deal:

* Base Trim
* 76,000 miles
* $34,000 out the door price
* estimated APR 4.5% (not final, but based on our good credit)
* 3 year service warranty
* my wife loves it

We can afford the estimated monthly payment, but I have some concerns and am leaning to some cheaper models on Carvana. I have never bought a car before besides very cheap used cars.  Any advice would be appreciated!  Thanks!

Hello everyone. 

Just looking for some help on what to buy. I am not a brand snob so any make is fine with me. I have been looking at a Kia stinger GT2 and Elantra N. GT2 used around 37k and N new for about the same. I want adaptive cruise, manual or auto. Would like 4wheel drive but not required. Needs to be a sedan or hatchback no 2 door car. Any suggestions or go for the Kia. The N does not have adaptive cruise. Also I would like it to be kinda newer like 2018 up

Thank you!

I want adaptive cruise, manual or auto. Would like 4wheel drive but not required. Needs to be a sedan or hatchback no 2 door car. Any suggestions or go for the Kia. The N does not have adaptive cruise. 

Thank you!

All those prices are for new 2022 models before taxes and fees, but including non-negotiable dealer add-ons and markups. Which of those options is the best deal? I can't find anything in my area selling at MSRP. (The only option I've been able to find with &lt;$1000 markup is a Kona SEL.)

 I really like the way Jeep Renegades look, and found one for $19k at 52k  miles. Is that a reasonable price and is it worth buying? I also saw a  2019 Ford Fiesta S with 38k miles at $16k. I've heard that Jeeps aren't  reliable and have transmission issues. Any advice would be appreciated?

I know absolutely nothing about cars and haven't really needed to drive for many years. Need to drive now, but only basic commutes.
I'm looking to get something basic.
Considerations:
- Driving to and from work, 20 minute commute each way 
- I'm a relatively inexperienced driver. 
- CA, no cold weather 
- I'm only 5'1". I'll be using a pillow but visibility matters to me
- New car would be better, only because I don't know enough to deal with the used car market
- Subcompacts are good too. I was considering a Honda Fit before they got discontinued. :(

Looking Smart Buy or alternatives to Camry/Corolla/Civic/Accord with better pricing and good reliability

it needs to be good on gas for daily stuff

but also  heavy duty for being worked. like when I move lots of stuff interstate
 

or run the engine for many many hours adding hundreds of hours of idling

I don't want to have to deal with everything breaking down from major engine components to the entire suspension and bushings and control arms

I want it to be able to handle work. heavy stuff for long periods of time. mildly rough terrain. 

being driven not driving like a grandma

I just need something large and reliable and heard trucks are that

but I also don't want it to be a gas guzzler

I don't want 20 mpg on the highway traveling interstate

I don't want it slurping 1 gallon every hour and half while idling 

it needs to be sturdy and able to handle moderate work but also not break the bank on gas when it runs for many hours a day (especially with prices)


budget is 9k&gt;

preferably 5k&gt;

I don't think I'm asking for anything crazy that would cost a fortune

Hello, Im looking to buy my first new car and could use some advise as to what I should be looking at. I have 2 criteria:

1) Ill be commuting roughly 110 miles round trip on highways with little traffic on weekdays, so my main concern is highway fuel efficiency

2) Id prefer a car that can fit 2 pairs of skis (either inside or on the roof)

I dont think an EV is possible for me since I live in an apartment complex without assigned parking (and I doubt any are within budget for me). Id love a hybrid but, from what I understand, they might not be the best for long distance highway driving. Id prefer not to buy used. With the amount I will be driving, I dont think I could lease for cheaper than buying. Thanks!

Hi, I moved to the u.s 2 weeks ago and am living with my grandparents for the time in east Texas.
I wanted to get a job first but i can't work here without a car since the distances are way too much to walk or even bike.

I need advice on a good reliable car i can buy(used or new) budget is around 20k, preferably a hatchback.

I am interested in a Corolla hatch but after some searching i found some USED for around 27-28k while the new msrp is 22k, if you could expalin why that is i would appreciate it.

Thanks in advance

Hallo, ich brauche ein neues Auto und habe mich hierbei in den a3 Sportback verguckt. Ich kenne mich mit Autos leider nur sehr sehr sprlich aus und wollte nach Tipps fragen wenn es um dieses Auto geht, bekannte Schwachstellen von diesem Auto, worauf ich speziell beim Kauf achten sollte oder oder oder. Jeder Tipp ist willkommen - JEGLICHER ART. 
Prinzipiell will ich ein Auto das so wenig Probleme macht wie mglich. Mein Geld Rahmen sind 8500 MAX. Mir wurde von dem Benziner abgeraten, ich mag Diesel aber ohnehin lieber. Und ich schaue auf Jahrgang 2006-2010 (hierbei sind wir bei 100.000-220.000km Pi Mal Daumen) ca. Wobei noch neuer natrlich immer geht. Der 2.0 TDI scheint mir eine gute Wahl zu sein wobei ich natrlich gerne den mit 170 PS nehme statt dem mit 140 PS allerdings kann ich da den Unterschied nicht so einschtzen also vielleicht ist es auch nicht so wichtig. ich bin auch gerne gewillt ihn chippen zu lassen. Eine Anhngerkupplung wrde ich auch wollen um ( vereinzelt) die Mglichkeit zu haben einen Hnger zu fahren( nichts groartiges). Ich habe auch gerne ein neues Radio mit Bluetooth oder Touch, aber sowas sollte man ja nachrsten knnen. Eben so wie mglicherweise eine besser Anlage(Subwoofer) knnte kommen, je nach dem wie gut die vorhandene ist. Nun wre meine Frage: Habt ihr irgendwelche Tipps fr mich - Schwachstellen, Dinge auf die ich achten sollte teile die vielleicht am besten getauscht werden sollten was wei ich. Egal was ich bin um jeeeeden Tipp froh. Auch Radio Empfehlungen sind gerne will kommen ( die ich einbauen kann versteht sich). Gibt es Dinge die man wissen sollte bla bla bla. Einfach alles so das ich den best mglichen Kauf machen kann. Danke schonmal im vorraus und ich hoffe ein paar erfahrene Leute unter euch helfen mir das ich meinen Kauf nicht bereue oder Probleme auftreten von denen ich nichts wusste.

P.s. Ich antworte sehr schnell also knnte ihr mich gerne auch noch nach zustzlichen Informationen fragen wenn diese helfen. 
P.p.s. Das bei einem Auto natrlich auch Sachen kaputt gehen knnen die untypisch sind oder unvorhergesehen und ein privat Kauf immer Risiken hat wei ich.

Looking to purchase a new truck within a few months.  I'm hoping this incoming recession brings up the new car supply so I have more to choose from and not paying over MSRP - which as of now all dealers in my area are charging additional dealer markups.

I'm trying to consolidate vehicles (F150 8' bed and Acura SUV) and ultimately need a 4 door pickup suitable for kids in front facing child seats, no RWD, capable in snow for ski trips, under $42k.  Has anyone else been in both vehicles?

(Also considering placing an order for the Maverick when orders open back up, but the small bed has me concerned - then again for the savings and gas mileage I can rent a vehicle when I need to haul materials locally.  The up front savings though will likely be offset by lower resale value compared to the Toyota/honda)

This will be my daily driver but also a weekend vehicle with a family of four.  I will want a roof rack to haul camping and fishing gear.  I do not need a 3rd row. I like tech and would prefer a nicer interior. I like the look of explorers, 4runners, Bronco sports, Santa fe, and foresters. Planning to keep this vehicle 10 years+ 

Any thoughts or advice?

Has anyone that owns the elantra preferred 2022 Canadian model , experienced any issues so far and how has a reliabilty been. I have initially go to get a civic base model but now my order is delayed and an elantra I can get in a few weeks but will have to pay a 4-5k over regular pricing. I saw some people mention heavy engine oil consumption

***Citroen C3*** is being launched on June 5th this year in India. This hatchback is all set to take on models like Magnite, Sonet, Ignis and Punch which is already performing very well in the domestic auto market.

C3 will be Citroens second model to be introduced in India. Appearance-wise, C3 is a smaller C5 Aircross with a number of similar interior features included like the colour palette and the AC vents. It also has a higher stance even though it is only a hatchback. Size-wise, C3 will be standing at the higher end of the line of hatchbacks.

Looking to get a new car. I snowboard so awd is a must. Gas prices are crazy and I dont see that changing so good mpg would be nice. I love being able to sleep in my car when camping etc. This is probably the least important of the criteria but damn it I want it all. I love the reliability of Toyota but the prices are so high these days. Something like a hybrid awd Sienna would be a dream car but Im 26 and a server at a restaurant so I dont have 40k to spend. $10-15k is what Im looking to spend ideally closer to 10.

Ok so Ive decided on the Chevy bolt euv with help from you all. Now I need help deciding to either lease or buy? Ive never leased neither has anyone around me. I planned on keeping the bolt for 3-5 years or 100k miles at the longest. If I lease it for three years my monthly payment would be the same as 84 month finance. Im considering leasing because I would not have to put down a down payment. Also by then I would have a way better job. Im not sure if theres any other factors you need to know. Thank you for the help!

Im looking at used cars right now and currently deciding between a 2013 Kia Soul (108k miles) and a 2015 Chevy Sonic (118k miles). Both have been serviced regularly and have no history of accidents. I test drove both today and they both drove really nicely. Its a hard decision because I feel good about both of them. 
Does anyone here have any thoughts? Is there any reason why one car might be better than the other? Im planning on using it for city and highway driving, and drive about as much as the average person.

Currently in a 2011 Ford Fiesta, It's treated me well and I love the gas mileage but I've definitely outgrown this car to say the least, I'm looking to upgrade to something with a little more room for starters, I'd like the vehicle to still have decent gas mileage and it needs to be reliable as I am looking to travel the country with it. Also I should mention this is recreational traveling and not anything for work.

So, I have a 2017 Dodge Charger SXT AWD with 75k miles. With how the market is it kind of opens up an opportunity to pull trigger on a brand new car. The stinger sure is tugging at me a little bit but is it worth it when I already have a set of wheels? Thoughts please, maybe im just thinking too much in to this

 Im looking at buying a new car for a move interstate, and ideally for the next 5-10 years. Ive found a used Impreza Hatchback MY16 with \~100,000 miles for $10,500. The seller took it to a local mechanic for inspection, theres absolutely nothing wrong with it currently but the mechanic warned me that hes seen a few Subaru CVTs need replacing around the 100k mark. The seller is an older couple that have done a few road trips themselves, so Im confident the transmission is in fairly good condition as of now (its not like its been abused by a younger guy street racing). Is this a good deal or should I keep looking?

Purchased my first used vehicle in the United States (CA) today and am so annoyed I didnt catch this. Found this vehicle on Craigslist which had just been posted. 1 owner and 105k mileage. Agreed over the phone to meet at location of sellers choice (beside sellers work) and everything looked great. The car was as described in CL and seller seemed genuine. After looking over the car he showed me the printed out carfax which all seemed to line up so I made the deal. Fast forward a couple of hours and I decided to run the carfax myself which states it is a 4 owner car with the last service being 200k miles. Nightmare. 
I dont know how to move forward with the title as he wrote the sale as gift and I have no bill of sale for purchase. Is it possible for me to scribble over gift and write the purchase price? I do not want to get into trouble for this and admit I should have seen the red flags. Any advice would be appreciated

I'm soon going to need a truck for race car and travel trailer hauling purposes, expecting to tow 1-3 times a week, I'm not a diesel guy but I wouldn't mind a duramax 2500 even though I'm a ford guy, but I'm really eyeing a 2wd twin I-Beam front end ford super duty with the 6.2 in 350 form so I can get the 10 speed (if you get the 250 you get the older 6 speed) but I'm wondering if I'd be best off finding a used duramax over a new 6.2, mileage isn't a massive concern for me because my only current towing-capble vehicle is an 03 Lincoln navigator that also happens to be my daily for the time being and gets an average of 10mpg on a good day on premium (it's just as expensive, if not more, as it sounds) I literally get as good mpg as my parent's 80s big block chevy powered tandem axle motorhome, sometimes worse, and basically anything is an improvement, I do also wonder if I should consider a 1500 like a coyote powered f150, or maybe even the powerboost or an ecoboost (though I hate the way f150 ecoboosts drive, personal preference and nothing you say will change that) or if I should even limit myself to open trailers and a light camper and get a ranger, though that 7500lbs tow capacity is a squeeze for most loads, but also the MPG is delicious. 

I've done a lot of research and I kinda know what I want/need but I'm also not 100% sure what route I should go, I just know I want reliability which to me means either 2.3 ranger or 6.2 super duty with maybe a well maintained coyote f150 peeking it's head in, chevys AFM and dodge's.. everything... scares me when it comes to reliability, though I love me a good durtymax.

Sorry for the wordy post. I just kinda need help talking through stuff.

I am looking at 2021 Ioniq Blue used car with 10k mileage which was a rental with 1 owner and no accidents previously with one oil and filter changed at 7k miles. I will be doing a combined driving in the city to get to work basically. I had a look at the carfax report and it shows that it went to different dealers on 3 different states and auctioned off. Would I take that as a red flag even with the low mileage? Thank you.

Im looking to upgrade from my cruze. Is this is350 a good deal? I'm hoping to keep it for 8+ years. I'm concerned about the mileage Also. 

- 13' base model is350 AWD / 93.2 miles for $13.2k at dealership.
- No accident, car reside in small town, no maintenance records, it was a rental car for first few years and then owned by one owner afterward.

I (16) currently drive a 2021 Honda Civic, and I cannot stand it. There is just something infuriating about sitting in the car, I feel like the car is eating me alive, or like I'm sinking into the car. The way the seats are shaped and the way that the whole interior is shaped is just  too horizontal (I don't know if that even make sense but I don't know how else to describe it). I avoid driving as much as possible because I can't even get comfortable as a passenger let alone a driver. I'm 5 foot for reference, and I've driven friends cars that I fit great in and I love how they feel. The only one that I can remember the name of was a Camry. Does anyone know cars that feel like a Camry to sit in? and since I'm only 16, my parents aren't willing to spend a bunch of money on the car.

Recent college graduate. Ive never owned a car but Ive driven everything from my parents sedans/mini SUVs to F150s for work during university. As of right now my upcoming job is going to pay very little (~$45k) and its going to be about a 1.5hr commute one way, more or less, in a high population area. Its about 40 miles one way. It might sound like a bad deal but I have pretty good reasons to go through with this.

My family have always purchased Toyota. I was hoping that a Prius might help the commute in regards to gas and allowing me to utilize the HOV lane.

Additional info: I transport a lot of plants so I like trunk space and plan on transporting skateboards and surfboards to the coast very often (on the top of the car with a rack?).

Is a new Prius a good option for me? Or are the benefits Im imagining just wishful thinking? Im a bit wary because so many people have negative things to say about Prius. If there are any alternatives, Id appreciate suggestions too!

Follow up post to my last post. 

Considered new vehicles over the used BMWs and Audis I thought were good buys. 

I was priced $48K CAD OTD for a 22 Camry V6 XSE. Lease rate was 7.49% and finance was 8%. 

Lexus down the road gave me an offer on a brand new IS300 F Sport 1 for $52K CAD OTD with 3.9% lease rate and 5.9% finance. 

I didnt even bother with Acura and BMW as their rates were equally as stupid as Toyotas. 

The catch 22 here is that the Toyota dealership is offering me $16K for my car and the Lexus dealership wants $12.5K for my car (16 Camry XSE). Other places like Canada Drives where they literally just take the car off your hands for cash offered me $18K but I cant apply this value to the whichever car I purchase without being left car-less for at least a week. 

My head hurts. Do I need a new car? I dont know? Its the time to sell. I got 150K kilometres on my Camry right now and fear if I wait any longer the market might lose value and my car will be worthless. 

Just right now I got big ticket maintenance for my car flushing all fluids, spark plugs, tires etc. Easily will be spending $2K.

Im on the fence on what to do and I am confused.

I purchased a car on 6/4 from a Subaru dealership. I picked it up on 6/6 as it needed to have the windshield replaced for a crack. On 6/8 I had to take it back for a check engine light (bad turbo) they sent it to Audi to have it looked at (4K to fix). Now 6/16 the dealer wants to reverse the deal because they dont want to pay to fix the car even though they sold the car to me with a warranty (30day/1000miles they pay 100% parts and labor) can they do that? Is it even legal? This is in Virginia.

Hi all. Thanks to your advice here we placed a reservation for the VW ID.4 back in March but it looks like it won't reach us until the end of this year. While this is like that we have a sedan which is eating up a lot of gas being an Accord (2017) with 35ish mpg. With the growing gas prices we were thinking of replacing this with a hybrid to speed up savings and trading in this Accord (quoted to give us around 10k in trade in value). We want a sub $200 lease or below 30k on the hybrid. We are a little wary about going down the PHEV route or getting another EV due to prices, availability, and having 2 EVs might not be smartest idea.

The main contenders we have rn are Hyundai Elantra Hybrid, Honda Insight, and Toyota Prius. The Prius doesn't seem to win in any areas other than hybrid tech and fuel economy, but will consider if it is still considered the best. If Hyundai or Honda can save similar amount of money while providing an overall better experience we might go that way. Are there any other options to consider, or reasons to get a PHEV or other type?

Hello! So Im currently looking for a car Ill share my options but for now this is my backstory. So Im a single mother and Im going to be attending college soon in person. As of now Im looking for a reliable car that will be able to take me where I need to go and a safe one as well since Ill be driving around with a baby. I wont be driving too far but quite frequently. 
Budget: 8k-9k 

-First option
So my mother told me she will sell me her 2015 Jeep cherokee with 70k miles I believe for 5k. She bought it new but its just has so many issues with it since she bought it. It has stopped on the road a couple times and its always something with the tires, or mechanical problems. As of right now there was been no issues with the car but it drives smoothly. Its spacious for a baby. Another thing is shes looking for a new car but shes been looking since December (she picky so its taking a while) and I really need it now. 

-Second option
So Im looking around used cars to buy off the street on Facebook market Ive found quite a few I like such as mazdas, Lexus, Kias. Some are salvage title which my dad prefers I dont buy. Miles from 100k-130k. Would that be a lot of miles for a used car? I mean my budget would be 9k. 

Can anyone give me some advice or suggestion on what car I can buy that would suit me, on my budget, and quite the long run? What I should look for, be careful for etc. Thank you! 
(Anyone welcome to pm me to discuss)

My 2015 q7 tdi is in the process of being totaled after a seemingly minor fender bender and we need to replace it asap. as our other car is a short range leaf that can't road trip.

Requirements: AWD, some ground clearance, minimum 25mpg highway, room for 4 with ski gear (roof box for skis), can tow 3000lb tent trailer, lots of leg room to fit 6'3" me with a kid in a carseat behind me.

Debating new vs used but thinking used and a bit older to hold us over until I can go electric in this role. The audi got 30mpg on the highway which has me spoiled but don't think I want another TDI as they are getting old and I am afraid of electronic or emissions issues leaving me stranded. 

Currently leaning towards a 2011-2014 highlander hybrid, we looked at a 2015/16 when we bought the audi in 2016 and I didn't like the seats. Would also consider a new highlander hybrid or sorento/santa fe hybrid if I could find one available at msrp but that seems unlikely without a long wait.

Anything else fit these criteria? Not sure if the size down crossovers will hit the towing and passenger space needs.

I care more about TCO than purchase price and in my experience and usage this usually favors used cars in good shape, but the market is all whacked out right now with no signs of improving.

I'm looking for something I can fit comfortably in, has decent fuel efficiency, and won't have the transmission die at 30k miles (looking at you Nissan...). The budget can stretch a bit either way if it's worth it, but I would like something of decent quality that will last for a good while. I'm partial to sedans but open to other suggestions of course. Thanks in advance!

I've narrowed down my choices between these two. Ideally, I know minivan is better than midsize SUV but there's a markup on the Odyssey.

2022 Toyota Highlander XLE
No markup. Around: $42,000

2023 Honda Odyssey Sport
Around $4000 markup. $46500

Toyota Sienna has no stocks around the area. Even higher mark up on the Pacifica.

I'm leaning towards the Highlander. What do you guys think? Is the minivan worth the extra $4-5k

Hey guys! My husband and I are looking to get a new SUV (or SUV close) car, and don't want to spend over 30k (that's slightly flexible, but we'd like to keep it below that.) I am currently looking at a 2022 Corolla Cross LE. I like the features it has(I'm a fan of techy bells and whistles), and that it gets 31/33 MPG (I like to road trip a lot). I know I've heard a lot about this car, and it's also kind of hard to find in places right now, and we're looking to get something more openly available. I'd prefer new as well, but I don't mind it being somewhat used if it's in good shape (I sadly know little to nothing about cars or how much mileage they can take).

If you guys have any better recommendations, please let me know!  Monthly we're looking to spend between $400-$600.

Thanks!

Im looking to upgrade from a 1999 Toyota Corolla. My upper end is 12k but Id prefer to to do less than that if possible. Im mainly looking for reliability and a little bit more power. Right now Im mainly into a 2008 Honda Accord V6 or Toyota Camry. Any help is much appreciated thanks!

Going to do my best to keep this short and sweet. Im working on buying my first new car &amp; Ill share what Im looking for in a vehicle and the options Ive already been through. Id love to hear if anyone has any input on all of this.

I come from Upstate NY, where we have harsh winters (think digging your car out of 3 feet of snow every morning) so winter compatibility is a must. Im looking for a sedan and I prefer something with a lot of luxury features over something thats high performance. A fast car doesnt mean much to me, Id rather have the technology and interior space.

With gas prices being the way they are now, the need to be good on gas is a given. Im also not one to trade in my vehicle every few years and I plan to stick with this one all the way to the end of its life, so it should be something with a low insurance cost and something that wont need repairs if treated well.

Budget is about 28-30k

Other options Ive looked at:
- Nissan Altima (abandoned this idea due to CVT issues)

- Acura TLX &amp; Genesis G70 - too high cost to own (since the G70 takes premium &amp; is low gas mileage, and the TLX has higher maintenance costs than the others and is more expensive)

- Honda Accord Touring, abandoned this idea, not good in the winter

Currently Im set on the K5, but Id like to hear everyone elses thoughts before I go ahead with this. I dont want something you see on the road everyday so that takes out of the question the typical Camry or Legacy, and like I said I do prefer something that is distinguished with its luxury features.

Thank you so much in advance I appreciate you all

Hello,

Looking to buy the model stated in the title and I cant find a solid answer online for mpg (Im mostly looking at highway). I was hoping someone could help me out.

Also wondering how they do on steep hills and windy roads? Im looking for a commuter to drive the 30 miles to my work. Its almost all highway but it is steep and windy so if thats going to make mileage plummet I might be barking up the wrong auto-tree.

Lastly, how does the 4 door compare to the coupes? And how do folks feel about this model? Seems uninspired but dependable as hell (just like me)!

Cheers!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Cheap to maintain 
Around 3.000 - 7.000
Good mpg
Fun to drive
To drift around corners 
LiL bit luxury interior

For reference Im a college student with a relatively low budget for a car. But a 2011 Mustang GT has been for sale near me for a few months now and they keep lowering the price. The only problem is that it has 160,000 miles. Its a 5.0 automatic so no mt82, and the owner says its still going strong(I know it might be lying). Does anyone know how long coyotes can run for even with driving them rough? I understand that stuff will happen, just not looking to drop a new motor in

I've taken a look at the Lamborghini Urus and Porsche Macan Turbo although according to CarWow, the Lamborghini Urus may not be worth it.

Can someone either recommend a SUV around this price bracket with 4-5 seats or a lower end SUV and a sports/super car similar to a McLaren or Porsche etc.

Not a car nerd so I don't know most of my stuff, reason why I feel like I'd be able to get my answers from you out there.

Last week,  I bought and totaled a 2012 GMC Sierra when I punted a deer at 75MPH on the highway. I was really happy with the deal I'd gotten on that truck but it wasn't enough to get the truck repaired. Unfortunately, it appeared to be an automotive unicorn for me as I'm not finding another deal like it.

I know I'm cheap. I've only recently resolved my underemployment issues after a working career of barely scraping by. Literally, any vehicle I could want would have a monthly payment less than a week's gross pay, yet I cannot wrap my head around a car payment that looks like my mortgage payment. I know interest rates have gone through the roof, but, damn. Some of these rates are just stupid.

I have been eyeing a car for sale in my area for around a month now. 2014 Audi Q5 TDI Prestige with ~83k miles priced at $21,256 as of today.

Comparing these TDI Q5s to the 3.0T are pretty tough. Both seem to have engines that have nightmare problems for some people or reliable for others. Diesel mpg is way better too so that and the torque are why Ive leaned towards the TDI.

I test drove it and quite enjoyed the ride, and the vehicle was in great condition with new brakes, tires and paint correction from the dealer. Good service history with 75k mile service recently and other intervals serviced according to the schedule it appears. Car was first bought in NJ and then has been in AZ since about 2016/17.

They wouldnt budge when I first drove it and tried to negotiate. The price was originally $22.9k then jumped around up to $24.9k and they have not sold it, so dropped it to $22,256 just the other day. 

Im very tempted now. Just a few hesitations: 
- Diesel prices long term (appear to be trending up and staying pretty flat, inelastic demand with semi-trucks in need of it regardless, and refining constraints for the ULSD)
- Audi/VW dieselgate warranty expiring possibly mid-2023. When does the 10 year date start? First sale to an owner or when the dealer first had it? I am considering an aftermarket warranty once this expires.
- Depreciation. The car would be ~$24k out the door from the dealer and I am wondering on r/tdi thoughts on whether these will drop like a rock when used car prices decrease or if diesels might keep a bit more value due to their rarity and not being sold in the US any longer.

Should I talk myself out of this or go full send? I can definitely afford this car and continue with maintenance, but if I kept it for 3-4 years would this be a stupid buy due to depreciation?

Thanks in advance for all your thoughts!

So here's my dilemma. I got $6,800 to buy a used car for myself. I have a buddy who is offering me a 1988 Cheby 1500 for $2,500. The chevy is in good shape but not fit for commuting every day so I wanted to get a motorcycle I was offered for $3,000 alongside side the Chevy. So should I get both the Chevy and the motorcycle for $5,500 or get a 2007 Chevy Avalanche I was offered for the full $6,800

For context: I currently drive a 2016 Mazda CX-5 and am pretty happy with it, it handles nicely and gets decent gas mileage. But I have twins in rear facing car seats and a tall husband whose knees are getting crushed. Well be able to turn the seats and get a lot more room in about a year. I also commute over 100 miles a day and drive into a major city with chaotic and heavy traffic. So I need to find something that balances space for my family and large dog as were starting to try to do more, but I also want to somewhat enjoy the 2.5 hours I spend in my car every day and have decent gas mileage. My work parking garage has a an EV charging station and I have 240V outlets in my garage. I plan to get AWD as well. 

Listed below are some options I have looked at, but Im very open to suggestions. The VW/Porsche line is off my list though, I cant overlook their history and support them. 

I looked at the RAV4 Prime, but Im not sure Id really be gaining space and the waitlist is 9-12 months. I wasnt shocked but I dont intend to wait that long. The Hyundai Ioniq is very intriguing! All electric sounds really nice, though I wouldnt really be gaining on legroom. There is availability near me so Im thinking of at least test driving one and bringing my measuring tape. I also looked at the Volvo XC40, but it seems too small. Those were the all electric vehicles that seemed like a decent fit for me, but I havent thoroughly explored other options. 

The Toyota Highlander Hybrid seems like a decent option with a tiny bit more space and good mpg. Also should have some zip with the V6, which it sounds like theyre dropping next year?! I looked at the Subaru Ascent, but the gas mileage isnt as good and I dont know how peppy it would be as a 4 cylinder. Looks like the Volvo XC60 hybrid is smaller than the Highlander, more expensive, and only has a 4 cylinder as well, though I may be wrong on that. 

I also looked at other options like the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60, and Mercedes GLE 350 but Im not sure. I think they win on fun, are even on size, and fall behind on gas mileage. 

Id welcome any suggestions or insight on the models Ive listed!

Hi all, this is both a financial question and a car question, but ultimately I thought it would be better to ask here. I'm looking to buy my first car in a few months. I was initially keen on buying an EV due to the longterm savings on gas + being better for the environment. I was thinking of taking a loan out for 30k for 5 years and was eyeing the Leaf or the Kona Electric, but ran into two problems: 1) neither are in stock within 200 miles of me, 2) after doing the math, this would lead to a really tight monthly budget for me, even after factoring in the federal rebate for EVs. Point #2 is the main problem when I start looking at cars at a higher price range that are in stock like the Ioniq 5. 

Though I earn about $6700 a month, because of the high cost of living in the area + other monthly costs due to taking care of pets and two other people, I already use up about $5800. Given all this in mind, does it still make sense to try and get an EV - would that save more in the long run? Or would it be better to get a gas-powered or hybrid car? And what would be good cars to look at that would make sense for my budget? If it helps to know, I have a good credit score (755).  Any advice would be much appreciated.

Just had a baby, the wife likes the CX5, but Im pretty sure that is too small with a rear facing baby seat.  I really like the CX70 and think it would be a really good car for us, problem is its not out yet.  We just moved out of a big city and need something now.  Ive tried looking for short term leases in our area and it doesnt seem like they exist, least no dealer is will todo a short term until the cx7 is released.  What are the best options in this case?

I have been driving for a few years now and finally decided it was time to stop leeching off of my family's cars. I have several thousand saved and I have an idea of what type of car I'd like but I know nothing about buying cars. I am interested in budget cars with minimal issues. Project cars are ok with me but I need them to be able to drive. If I could get any car I would love a classic MX-5 or an E30 but neither of those is achievable for me. I love the JDM scene, but more the cosmetic part than the racing scene. I have been settling with a Honda Civics as a cheap, reliable, and good project car, but I'm wondering if I have any better options. My question here is 1. Recommendations for cars that are relatively modular, something to experiment with, but still reliable enough, and 2. What to look for when buying cars. I have familiarized myself with some terms but overall am clueless when it comes to specs or parts.

Hey there, Im planning on picking up a new ride in a few months and Im going over some options. Im in a 07 g35 sedan at the moment and want something smaller, lighter, and a bit quicker. 

I definitely want to go with a sportier coupe with tight responsive handling, and 300-350hp at the very least. Budget is about 35k but can be stretched for the right car. 

So far on the cheaper end Ive been looking at some ~2014 BMW Z4 sdrive35is, love the looks, and the 335hp from the n54 would be doable. Concerns with this car are mainly handling, and reliability of the n54. From what Ive read it feels a bit disconnected, especially for the style of car it is. And from everything Ive heard regarding the n54 it is a fantastic engine but can run into some issues. 2 of my good friends are BMW techs though so Id have good help. Prices for low mileage ones arent too bad though. 

Another option Ive been considering is stretching the budget for the new 400z. Power is great, from what Ive read it handles tight and responsive, and it looks amazing. Ive also thought about a used q60 red sport but I dont want to spend that much on a car with 30k+ miles on it at the moment. 

Any input or other suggestions with similar cars would be appreciated:)

Howdy. I currently DD a '98 cherokee, and as the title says, I'm looking to find a replacement for the day to day commute. I'm trying to see how close a new car can get to the driving experience I have in this one: small(ish) body, high(ish) off the ground, 4wd/awd, good visibility, more of a rugged shape than round, capable in snow, capable of easy overtaking/getting to merging speed safely. 

Things I'd like to avoid: overly colorful interior trim (stitching, shift knob, etc). Overly round body shape. poor reliability. too large for city parallel parking. 

I don't need too many creature comforts, but if sunroof, non-cloth seats, and wireless CarPlay can fit my budget (\~32k) on any candidate cars, they'd be higher on my list. I'll likely be buying used with under 40K miles depending on what I can find. 

Some of the contenders so far are the Crosstrek Sport/Limited, Rav4 (2019-present), Bronco Sport, and Seltos SX, Cherokee/Compass. Each of these has downsides that have prevented me from pulling the trigger whether it's price, interior/exterior styling, reliability, etc. 

Any recommendations out of the options listed or others that might fit my search?

I bought my first car paying 200 a month and making around 293 a week working 3 days a week. Since Im buying a new car and making a 50k salary now would it be reasonable to raise my monthly payment some? If so how much? Also Im the one thinking about the bolt euv so if I get that with my down payment it would be around 200 so basically the same. ( I plan on keeping the car for 3-5 years so my only other monthly expenses would add up to around 450 a month.) Im looking at evs I love the mach e but there selling for 50k which is way too much.

I just bought a 2022 Toyota Camry LE AWD from the dealership. MSRP is $26,795 plus some optional equipment that cost $786 and delivery/handling cost $1,025. All together I paid $28,606. 

The dealership included an additional accessory of Diamond Fusion Windshield protection for $995. Apparently, its just to protect windshields and includes a 3 year warranty to replace a broken windshield. Does it sound like I got scammed?

I dont know if this belongs here, but I need help. 

So I got a new car while mine was in the shop. I had the title with me and this dealership was desperate for a sale I guess? I told them they hadnt entirely diagnosed whats wrong with it yet and it had been sitting in my garage for a few years. Its a nice car though, a 2013 Lexus ES350h. Its in great shape interior/exterior. It just had to be towed to the shop. Well they said theyd take my title and gave me a low ball as a trade in (20k) sell me the car I was looking at. I told them the mechanic hadnt fully diagnosed it and I didnt want to do anything shady, but they said they understood the risk. Now I find out its the engine as the mechanic called me this morning. I immediately called this dealership and told them for transparency sake. Now theyre saying they want me to give the car I bought back? Can they do that if they sold it to me? If not, what do I say? 

Thank you!

Hey all. Here seeking some opinions on the above matter. I currently drive a 2011 MDX as my daily.  Those who have one I'm sure know that premium gas prices and surprisingly shitty mileage aren't really a great duo to deal with at this time so I'm wondering if it would be worth buying a 3-5k little gas sipping, easy to work on car like a Civic or Corolla and just park the MDX for the summer and put storage insurance on it. Appreciate any advice. Thanks!

We have owned a 2010 Mazda5 for 12+ years and have had a great experience with that vehicle.  Current circumstances mean that it is time to replace the Mazda5, but we are having a heck of a time finding something that is even close to equivalent in today's market.  The compact class of CUV/SUV is where we have been primarily looking, but nothing out there now is like what the old Mazda5 offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions of where to start looking???  (knowing that we might have to compromise and go with a 5 passenger vehicle)

&amp;#x200B;

Basic search parameters:  new vehicle in central US, up to $31k OTD, 6 passengers, small-ish exterior but good interior cargo space, decent fuel mileage, reliable

&amp;#x200B;

Vehicles considered:  Mazda CX-30 (too small), Mazda CX-5 (too pricey for what is available, only has 5 seats), Buick Encore GX (seems the best fit as of now), Volkswagen Tiguan (only looking at the S trim)

&amp;#x200B;

Other notes:  Honda, Toyota, Kia/Hyundai, and Subaru dealers in our local market don't have inventory and/or have much bigger markups than other neighboring markets

I want an affordable, reliable 4 seat car that I can have fun driving around with. Under $10k I don't have much money unfortunately. I don't really care how old it is, as long as if I do have to repair it, it won't be crazy expensive. I also want decent mpg. I do know a little about cars but not that much. Since I live in the city I've never had a car and used public transportation to go everywhere. If y'all can let me know if I have any options that would be great. Thanks!

160K miles -- Single lady with no mechanic skills. Looking for a better MPG all purpose, including some long distance travel.  I've requested the VIN to check history. Thoughts on if this is a good deal? Reliability in general on this year/make/model?

Title says it all. Black 2009 Lancer Ralliart with 150,000km (93,000 miles). Im 20 years old and this will be my second car, Im looking for something with some style but is also fun to drive. Has this thing got the best of both worlds or will it just be a money pit?

Should I lease a Camaro Lt1 for about $440/ month for 36 months with a $3,000 down payment?

Wish I had more to say but this is basically my dream car, but dont know if this deal would make sense.

I am in the market looking for a Lexus LS 460L I have made up my mind and excited to own one. However, I cannot seem to be able to make up my mind between the two eligible candidates of similar mint condition and proper service history Lexus LS460L 2013 or 2016. 

My argument is should I pay $40K on a 2016 low mileage relatively newer more time till things go bad or $25K for a slightly older and save money but take the risk of maybe something going bad soon. 

Thank you in advance to whoever would help me decide.

Currently looking for a first car and there happens to be a 2005 Civic for $4500 with ~128k miles

What do you guys think of this? Its a bit old but seems like it is in good condition. I havent called the number yet to check it out so Id like to know if it is even worth it?

Im in the market for a car, just got my license. I have past trauma from a car accident so Im looking for a safe, reliable car with modern features (rear view camera and blind spot assistance) and smooth drive. Approved for 20k and found a 2020 Corolla for 19k with 60k miles as it was a rental. Is this a good choice for a first car that meets my needs?

I am overhauling my garage and could use some help. 

I sold my c7 corvette in mid 2021 for more than I bought it for, and I am really wanting to get back into another sports car. I can either purchase a project car (something I have wanted for a while), or purchase a new C8 corvette. 

I found a drivable, good condition 1965 mustang that I can make into a project car. I dont want to have a ground up restoration, just something I can daily drive, and work in as needed. 

I also have a reservation to buy a c8 in about 13 months at MSRP. Although I can afford to pay cash, I feel like the c8 is expensive, and Im unsure if its a good financial decision. I would love to find a used one for below MSRP, but times are weird. 

Another wrench is that I also have a reservation to purchase the new z06, but I am projecting my allocation will be ready in about 4 years. I will definitely get the z06 when its ready. 

So what should my strategy be? Buy the c8, and trade up for the z06? Or buy the mustang now and then buy the z06 whenever that is ready? 

FYI, I am getting an f150 lightning in about a month, so I am trying to not spend 160k on cars in one year, but I gotta admit, I love small block pushrod motors. 

The mustang is 25k
A c8 will be roughly 70k to 80k
Z06 will (hopefully) be no more than 100k.

I found this Pontiac Grand Prix for sale. I really like how it looks, esp with the body kit.

Obviously, not a whole lot is known about the car or how it was maintained. On the face of it though, are Pontiac Grand Prixs reliable, cheap to maintain first cars?

Would this car, provided a solid maintenance history, be a good choice?

I found a 2005 Cadillac Deville for sale on FB marketplace for $4800. It was elderly owned (1 owner) and only has 125k miles on it. Otherwise, its in great condition. The back seats look like they were never used and the front seats look equally as nice. There is no rust on the exterior, and everything inside works as it should (except the gas gauge, but its easy to count up 200 on the odo reading). The car fax shows changing of the oil, filter, etc every 3500 miles and a transmission fluid flush change, etc. the 100k mile service was completed as well and the cars tie rods, bushings, and struts were replaced.
Ive heard bad things about the Northstar V8 but otherwise like the car. Is this a good deal? 
Are these later northstars reliable?
Also, if not this 2005, I found other 2006-2008 DTSs for sale for under $6k as well. Would one of those, provided its well maintained, be a better choice?

I've been looking at cars on Craigslist and I've seen a few local mechanic shops that also sell cars. Here is an example:

Is there a benefit or risk to buying from a local shop like this? They have pretty good reviews online but they just refer to the mechanics and not the vehicles they sell.

TLDR- Sell my dream car and get something better on gas or get a daily for cheap +suggestions for either

Hello and thanks in advance. Ill explain to you my thoughts and would love input and suggestions.
I have a 15 X5 XDrive 50i that I absolutely love but these high gas prices are costing me $120 every fill up. My commute to work isnt very long ( ~5k a year ) but I still fill up often with my horrible mpg. Its my dream car that Ive worked hard for and searched for a long time (6 months) to purchase the perfect one (every option) I only owe $15k on it now and have an extended warranty for a few more years. Im also in the process of buying a home and my mortgage officer has told me that I would be approved for more if I didnt have this loan on my credit so Im considering selling it in and getting something that would be better on gas and that I would be able to buy cash so under roughly $20k I would want it to have good gas mileage so over 25 combined but I would also want it to be quick as I enjoy that about my car now and I also enjoy the luxury feel and some premium features but dont really know whats out there that can offer that (im tall so anything 2 door wouldnt work but I am open to sedans) im not worried about maintenance as I work at a dealer and will purchase a warranty for fairly cheap as well. 

My other option is to buy a fun $5k daily and garage the BMW but would still want good mpg and good speed at that price features and luxury arent a concern plus I would drive the bmw whenever I want something nice to ride.

Im a 17 year old still somewhat learning how to drive. Im working and saving up money this summer to buy myself my first car. Id like something I likely wont run into problems with, is good on gas, looks decent, and something I could have fun driving. My budget is around $3000-$4500. Any suggestions appreciated.

In the nearby futur I might become homeless and I am considering buying a car to live in for a moment. 

It has to be less then 3000$ and be relatively cheap to maintain. A huge plus would be back seats that folds flat (to allow a mattress )

Also I dont drive manual but I am willing to learn What are my option? Dont hesitate to put the most amount of information possible ex: years to avoid

Any thoughts on the Encore pro or con?

Budget is 10K. Looking to buy a mid-size suv. 3rd row would be nice but we can live without it. Cargo space behind the 2nd row is important. Reliability is important.

Hi guys, Im 16 years old and have about 8-10k to spend on a car. My parents pay for insurance and gas so I dont need to worry about that. Just wondering what some fast fun cars are for 16 years olds to have. Here are some of the cars ive been looking at to give you an idea of what I like- 
350z
2006-2010 Mustangs
BMW series 3 
Pontiac GTO
Honestly ive been leaning towards the GTO even though its the most expensive, havent seen any decent ones under 9k, but it seems pretty nice on the inside and really fast. Any input you guys have would be appreciated!

I am planning on trading in my mk7 GLI for a manual coupe. Ive been looking at 996 911s and 987 caymans. Ive also been considering a Honda s2k, but this is a pretty significant amount of money for an older vehicle. Ive also looked at 997 911s but those are upwards of 40-50k. Are there any other manual coupes in this price range other than brz/gr86 or a miata? Im open for recommendations/suggestions. Thank you guys for your help!

Hi all, looking at a couple of small to mid-size SUVs, and considering a tuning chip to improve performance. I noticed that one tuning chip includes an engine warranty. General googling is providing mixed responses. Couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are tuning chips bad for engines?
2. Do they traditionally void warranties?
3. If tuning chips are not bad for engines and do not void warranties, what is the downside or trap to adding one?

&amp;#x200B;

TIA!

I know the 202k miles is a dealbreaker for nearly all of yall, but I just need it to move around in my area. I bet it can go up to 250k miles if not near 300k. Its well maintained since its from a family member. Should I bite?

 I'm 34F. Long story short: I have significant driving anxiety, and always tried driving in other people's cars. My boyfriend says I should go for a Japanese car (Toyota, Nissan or Honda). My biggest issue is I feel like I can't see well because I'm short (5'3"ish). Could anyone suggest a good starting model that is good for my height and just all round reliable car? I don't care if it looks super flashy.

Need guidance between buying a new car and fixing my current one. My Dad and I were going to work on it together this summer since he was a skilled mechanic, with him instructing and me doing it since he had a stroke and became disabled; but he passed away in April and I don't know what to do with my current car situation now that he's gone. RIP Dad &lt;3

Anyways,

My current car is a Manual '07 Base Honda Fit w/ 220k miles and has lots of ailments:  
\- Surges on acceleration (idk)

\-Front end clunks over bumps (idk)

\- Clutch/Transmission Fluid is shot (meaning new clutch kit + full service drain/fill/filter-change)

\- AC doesn't work (think it's just a leak because it was working a couple months ago? Probably needs new air filter) 

\-Moderate Sputters (spark plugs/coil pack?)

\- Needs 4 new tires (spare is fine)

 \-Brake service? They work fine, but part of regular maintenance. (Flush/Service/Pads???) -Whole column torn to shit, I start it with a chisel while the electric key plugs into the thing I have hanging off with duct tape (Ignition switch/key? seems optional) 

\-Timing Belt and Water Pump 

\-Horn doesn't work 

\-Tuneup 

\-Non-working fob and key doesn't unlock doors (only the back hatch) 

\- Drivers side door/seatbelt torn apart 

\-Seatbelt doesn't work, the metal bar just hangs and I set it off to the side to pretend I'm wearing a seatbelt - it might do a tiny bit for me if I get in a crash lol 

*I'm not sure what these repairs would cost*

*If someone experienced could give me a mildly pessimistic ballpark guess? I don't know how to work on cars beyond very basic basic shit. I have access to a fairly honest independent shop)*

$18.2k  @ Honda Dealership - 2018 Fit Manual w/ 50k miles (better aesthetics, clean interior, sport trim, aux, bluetooth/carplay)

I currently own a 2019 Kia Stinger and since becoming essential personnel for my job, in the winter it simply doesn't work anymore for me - RWD and poor visibility in bad weather conditions, so I'm crossover shopping.

Right now I have a Bronco Sport Badlands I ordered back in February which will be around $39,000 with taxes and fees when it shows up (no commitment)

vs

a well maintained, used 2020 Kia Sportage SX Turbo that got in an accident with no serious damage, fully loaded, with 44,000 miles for around $30,000 with an extended factory warranty.

Where my predicament lies is that CarMax is offering me a crazy amount for my car right now that expires on Friday the 17th. If I don't claim it, the CarMax offer goes way down and I feel it is only going to go lower as the recession picks up. I love the Bronco Sport Badlands, but it is a lot of money and my build date keeps getting pushed further and further back (June 6 to 13 to 20 and now 27) to the point where when it does show up, I could lose a few thousand on my CarMax trade-in.

My mind and my wallet think I should jump at something now before the market cools too much, but part of my heart and my parents think I should stay committed to the Bronco Sport, since they helped sell me on the car. On the one hand, the Bronco Sport is one hell of a vehicle and looks super capable, but not nearly as luxurious and sporty of a commuter like the Kia is.

What do you guys think I should do? I'm stumped.

Evening, I have a 2001 GMC YUKON XL and its ~$2000 to fix its current issues and isnt worth that price. My wife owns a paid off 2012 Toyota Camry. 

Id like to get my wife an suv/ minivan for her and my 2 kids (both under 3). We make 57k a year after taxes. We could probably afford to put 3k down and around $400 a month car payment. 

My parents have advised us against buying a used car greater than 6 years old(ie 2016 Toyota RAV4, 2014 Toyota Sienna, 2013 Toyota Highlander)but it seems like the smarter financial decision. My fear is that a buy a used vehicle and Im just buying a car with problems.

I'm in the market for a new daily driver that will be used to rack up a ton of mileage for my job, which includes lots of local mileage and long road trips on a regular basis on top of regular driving that totals $3k a month. 

To make a long story short, my company used to previously allow us to get rental vehicles on days we would drive 250+ miles round-trip or for overnight travel and pay mileage for regular local mileage. Now, with the higher cost of rentals, they are switching to a $500/mo car allowance on top of mileage for all travel. Right now, I have a '19 M3 and that's not something that is going to be very effective at all to daily for many reason, and  I don't rack up tons of miles like that on her. 

So, this has put me in a position where I will need to purchase a vehicle that I can use for this purpose. Generally, I am really into more engaging driver's cars, but my car is also my office  I'm also looking for something that's going to be a really good balance of comfort, fuel efficient, and preferably a little more lively than something like a camry. 

Budget-Wise, I'm looking between the $25k-$35k range new or used. I would prefer a sedan, but im open to crossovers/suvs for right value. I'm also very much open to hybrids or plug-in hybrids, but I'm honestly not up to par on what's what in that area. I'm also flexible in terms of budget if the cost of operation (lower fuel costs) makes sense. I'm not really in the market for an EV. I had a Model 3 before, it was fine, but not for me. Also due to the nature of my job and travel, there are locations that I travel to that I am physically uncapable of reaching/returning from certain places due to lack of charging infrastructure so it's not feasible yet.

Short list: first car that immediately came to mind is Elantra N. But, I'm told ride is a little on the stiff side like my M3 is and isn't going to excel in fuel economy so I don't know if it's going to check all the boxes. 

Civic Sport: I would enjoy an Si (or definitely an R), and as much as I would love a manual, It would be a bit of a hindrance for the type of day to day driving I do. I'm also a bit personally biased against Honda as a corporation for personal reasons. 

Jetta GLI: I honestly know very little about them but multiple people have recommended them to me. There's only one dealer within an hour of me and VW has a very small footprint where I live so availability is likely an issue.

Currently have a 2009 Matrix XR with 146,000km. I have a fear of the matrix consuming oil down the road (does not at the moment). Im a college student looking for a car that will last me for 4+ years. The car Im debating on reading my car in for is a 2003 Corolla CE with 126,000km. Both cars have zero rust, no accidents, clean inside and out. Should I do the trade?

I need to purchase a car within the next 2 weeks, and I'm looking for a small or midsize sedan. I'll be doing a lot of city parking and don't need tons of space. I was looking at getting a Civic or a Mazda 3, but there is basically no inventory near me (I'm in SoCal) and/or the markups are crazy. 

If you needed a small or midsize sedan quickly and could spend up to $40K, what would you buy? I'd love something fast, but main priorities are a nice interior, decent reliability and I need it pretty quickly. I'm fine with a new car or a recent model CPO.

Good afternoon to all, in a couple hours I am going with my grandpa to look at a 2013 Chevy Silverado, that a gentleman has up for sale. The truck has about 110,000 miles. I need to know what to kind of mishaps look out for, when I go look at the truck. Whats a reasonable starting asking price I should start with? Any tips and extra questions I should ask also. Thank you all in advance!

I'm really just looking for the most reliable car you can think of. I don't really care what it looks like. I just want something that will last for a decent amount of time and doesn't break down a lot. I've heard good things about Toyota's and Honda's, but that's all I know.

I'm also open to spending a bit more if I'm right below a threshold before cars "get good".

I'd also love your opinions on how much mileage and the year the car was manufactured matters. Is there a number of KM that is too high to ever be worth it? Will a sub 2010 car make sense to buy, or would I be throwing money away?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
so im hoping to be buying a car soon, im 16 and im just learning to drive, with these gas prices id prefer a hybrid if possible. are there some decent used ones for cheaper? what brand is good? any recommendations? i just want one thats reliable, affordable and good on gas hence wanting hybrid. is this a good idea?

Im strongly considering purchasing a 2020 Ram 1500 Classic SLT model with roughly 49k miles, but have a few concerns before I decide and could use some advice. Btw I would be getting a pre purchase inspection before signing any paperwork. 

1) Carfax shows its a former rental. Now Ive had good luck with my current vehicle that was a rental but its a crossover and would have only been used for travel, not like a truck may have been. Do people normally rent pickups to tow things, or do you think people typically would use a pickup for out of town travel and hauling things in the bed? Id be worried about people who dont have experience towing and ragging this one out. Also there arent many service records, but Ive read that major rental companies do regular maintenance and its in house. Heres a link to the Carfax

[Carfax](https://www.carfax.com/VehicleHistory/p/Report.cfx?partner=DEY_0&amp;vin=1C6RR6TT5LS135531)

2) Reliability: Ive seen some complaints here and there about the 5th generation Rams 2019 - Present, but not finding much info about the 2020 Ram Classic which I understand are considered 4th gen. I would assume that quality improvements would have been made from when the line eventually came out, but curious to hear advice. This truck does have the 5.7 V8 hemi. 

Id greatly appreciate your comments and thoughts.

I believe if the camry doesn't work that it rules out a Lexus 300h, Avalon Hybrid.

I sat in a continental (gas) and fit great but i'm not sure how that compares to a mkz

The price seems a little steep, but I need as new car as my 04 accord is on its last leg. Do you guys think I have any wiggle room in regards to price? With the market as it is, 9k for a used hatchback Toyota corolla with close to 100k miles doesn't seem so bad - as my area is flooded with Hondas that have salvaged titles and Lexus sedans with 160k+ miles for a similar price.

I currently have a 2015 Nissan 370Z nismo with 70k miles. Im having a difficult time deciding whether to get rid of it and get some sports sedan for 30-35k (Kia stinger or g70 or something else? Or just getting a beater.


Honestly both have been proven to be difficult with the current market. Looking for any tips or advice!

Im 16 so insurance may be high, I have a high budget of more or less 30k-ish for a car, I want something I dont need to work on, reliable, decent mpg, let me know!
-------------------------------

* The Kia has great tech but less mpg. The Honda has superior mpg but outdated tech.
* I like the look of the CRV more than the Sportage.
* CRV is getting a redesign for 2023 but I'm guessing it won't be available until next spring.
* Reputation of CRV is superior reliability. I like to drive my cars for at least 10 years.

I am planning on ordering a Ford Maverick in August and I was told by the dealer that it's going to take around 8 months to come in after the order is placed. The issue is my lease is up in two months so I am going to need a vehicle that will hold me over until the Maverick comes in and I don't know what to get. I commute about 55 miles a day.

Hello everyone

There's a listing for a new mid range kia tellurides 2021 going for a decent discount ( - 6k off the price of the same trim from 2022 )
Or wait for the new one and suffer through shortage and a higher price for sure.

Is the maintenance, tags, parts really expensive, sometimes I commute about three times a week, will i just drive into the ground? I know it all the depends on how you treat the car but I guess I'm just asking if the upkeep is expensive? Any advice helps!

Hello,

I have bought a car that doesn't yet have a logbook, the seller has said that he is waiting for the logbook to arrive in his name so it can then be transferred over to me.

How long does this normally take and is there anyway I can just apply for the logbook in my name without waiting for the seller? I have all the paperwork for the car bar the logbook such as service history, parts receipts etc.

Currently experiencing possibly expensive transmission issues in a car I've only put 15K miles on.  It's the "newest" car I've owned, a 2016 (make/model really not important, here, I think).  I bought it for $15K early in 2020.

The difficulty of doing anything ourselves, on this car - even oil changes - and the fact that there is NO transmission dipstick, and the transmission has to be (apparently) updated via dealer computer, at times, is frustrating.

I'm wondering if it's still possible to buy a reliable, affordable car (with good mpg) - that I can do much of the maintenance on, myself.  Is there any such animal?  I'm so tired of vehicles that are designed to force me back to a dealership or into expensive service/repairs.  Yes, new cars are generally more reliable, but I'd take understandable over "supposedly reliable" any day, I think.

Hi, im cirrently looking to replace my 07 Pontiac Vibe ive been driving since highschool. I live in northeast Ohio, and the rust is killing it more than the miles (about 130k.)

My goal is a car that get roughly the same or better mpg than my Vibe, around 30 combined,  and is either a hatchback or CUV, but im open to mid size sedans. It will mainly be used for a daily commute of 40 miles round trip, but also the occasional backpacking trip; passengers arent a concern. Reliability is important, this is going to be my last ICE vehicle and it will hopefully last at least 10 years. I would prefer an upper trim level for the better audio systems, and would also like AWD, but am very flexible on that.

My price range is a soft 30k new given the curent market. Vehicles ive considered are the Mazda 3 hatchback, Hyundai Kona, CX-30 Civic hatchback with the manual, and an Accord Hybrid. Im leaning mostly towards the Mazda, but im open to any opinions on these or other vehicles!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Need a new car, and obviously this seems nice. I hear about the reliability issues, but since this is only 1 owner and stock with such low miles, could this be worth it? Probably would only keep it for at most 40k miles.
I'm pretty technical and can do all of my own general maintenance and simple things, and willing to learn for bigger issues. Also have tools
20y/o student, trying to something manual, 30k price limit
My concern is all of the comments on the unreliability of this car. Let me know what you think

Its selling for 16500 with 80k miles. Original owner but something about the description makes me think dealership, but I did call and it was a lady , seemed like the voice of an elderly lady and when asked why she was selling it she said I have another Lexus 430 She also said she has 2 other cars. But to me thats not good enough because if I had 2 cars why would I get a third. Unless she has children I dont know her life though so I really shouldnt say much. Shes selling the v6 and keeping the v8? Is that a too good of a price too? When we got off the phone she said her niece will be using the car to drive around in the meantime so maybe she has three cars just for extra?

Hey folks, I am buying a small camper, and I am will need to get a different vehicle. I currently have a 2017 subaru impreza, which I love but won't tow!  I drive about 15 miles to work and back and to the store. I plan to tow the camper to local beaches and national parks a couple times a year and to NC/VA from southern TX about once a year. 

I see two options trading my car for a similarly valued car that can tow or buying a new car that tows. I really want a hybrid or plug-in vehicle, but these are super expensive. I would also love to wait a few years before getting one in case the technology improves. 

Big question - What do you think about a used Jetta SportWagen.  These are rated to tow about 2,000 lbs.  I am considering a gas-powered version from 2012-2015. 

Any thoughts?
-------------------------------

So I am a 26F who is going to use this car to commute to graduate school. I am debating between either a 2019 HRV which has 22K mileage, or a 2021 Hyundai Kona with a 4926 mileage. The price for the two cars are about the same. I was initially planning on buying a new car, however the new car market is bad right now. I am leaning towards the Kona.

This will be my first car and I do not need it for lots of storage. I will mostly be using it for grocery runs and commuting to school. Thank you!

As it stands right now, I have at least $13k in equity on our 1 year old Camry Hybrid. We bought it for about $28k and Carvana just offered $32.3k. At our current loan amount, that gives us $13.5k in equity. Add in that I don't pay sales tax when registering in my home state, it seems almost too good to pass up. Obviously I'd lose out on the MPG savings, so that's a concern. But the ability to wipe out a loan or have one that is smaller in size/monthly is appealing. Trying to find a 2016+ sedan that gets decent (not great) MPG that would be a good daily driver. Initial brands I had in mind were the usual JDM makers, and Volkswagen. Any recommendations on something that might fit? We're in south Texas so no need for AWD. Thanks guys!

I'm about to buy a 2010,115k miles, that's loaded with extras but I know that means it's also loaded with issues. What would you say you've spent on getting this car up to go go go condition? I am saving $3k on the car and I'm going to assume Shift.com does not change the timing belt or water pump. The original owner took great care of it but nowhere do I see these two things being replaced. Any real world ideas on cost here? I figure if my hood breaks then it's just a regular car because I doubt I'll be able to afford to fix it? And of course I live in Los Angeles where everything is SO expensive.

Basically, Im looking for a good size SUV. I can spend 25k max. I love Grand Cherokees. I found a 2016 Grand Cherokee near me for $25k with 45k miles. Obviously you cant be there to look at it, but would it be unwise to buy something like this, especially since I cant go there to test drive? I would be taking their word and they would be delivering it.

I am considering a 2019 Infiniti Q50 (CPO) or a 2015 Lexus GS350 F Sport. The Infiniti has 40k miles less than the Lexus, however price out the door difference is only 1700 between them.

For a daily driver, which would you choose?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to test drive either of them because the availability is so low in my area. I'm trying to decide between the Mazda3 Sedan Carbon Edition and the Civic Hatchback Sport Touring. 

The Mazda I am able to get at $31,243 OTD while the Honda I can get at $35,167 OTD.

I want a premium sound system with a comfortable driving experience, the back seat leg room doesn't really matter too much because I don't have children. I chose the hatchback version for the Honda so I could potentially have my dog back there, but I'd be fine with just tossing him into the back seat. I'm avoiding the Mazda hatchback because I hear it limits visibility a decent amount. The mpg on the Honda is nice and I don't particularly care whether the car has a powerful engine, just that it is a pleasant commuter car.

I'm looking to get into the car scene and know jack shit about them. I'm looking for something that's going to be reliable as it is going to be a daily driver, something that's going to be quick and handle well, and is going to have plenty of performance as well as aesthetic mods. As stated in title, its also going to be my first vehicle and my budget is right at 15k USD. Any tips for a newbie welcome as well!

Title explains it well.

I am moving 2,000 miles away and planning on buying a new car. I was going to fly to my destination then buy a car when I arrive but every dealership in the city literally has new cars anywhere from 4-6k above market value. Some places as extreme as 10k.  I was looking at 2022 Kia Forte - certain dealerships are quoting me up to $32,000 for the GT-Line model at the city I am moving to. If I was to buy one there I could only afford the base model and that's still going for $24,000. I've called every dealership in the area as well as cities within a 100 mile radius.

Regardless of the treacherous road trip, if I was to buy one here at MSRP, do you think a new car would be ok driving almost 1,000 miles straight a day? 

Both are terrible scenarios in my opinion but the used car market is insane and the APR on new vehicles is pretty nice. Not to mention warranties on lots of new cars too. 

Any advice helps, thank you!
-------------------------------

Hey y'all, apologies for the long post but I could use some advice...

TL;DR: My car was totaled and I want to buy a beater car to hopefully last a few years. Found an '04 Dodge Stratus with 81K miles, no accidents, 3 owners. How long and how well might such a car serve me without sinking a bunch of money into it?

More detail:

My '06 Pontiac G6 was recently totaled and I'm getting a new car. Since the car was so old, the settlement isn't too much (just north of $5K). With that money I'm hoping to buy a beater car to just make my commute (~160 miles/day, three days/week; that might become much less driving if I change jobs, but I'm trying to make my decision as if I'm keeping my current job).

Today I found a 2004 Dodge Stratus with ~81K miles, no accidents, 3 owners, with a history of both fleet and personal use. It's gonna cost me just short of $5K to drive it off the lot. It has a better estimated mpg than what my G6 was getting, and the price is right (I can't do a car payment at the moment). 

Is this actually worthwhile? I don't want to get a car that's gonna break down in 6 months or 5K miles and then have to pour more money into it or have to get a new car again. Reviews of the model seem good, but those that I found were dated, not as if buying an 18 year old car. 

Any insights or direction are greatly appreciated!

I am looking at cars that satisfy the following:

1) manual transmission  
2) V6  
3) relatively new (2018 -) that has modern features like apple carplay  
4) Not a muscle car (e.g., mustang or camaro)  
5) comfortable but can be sporty at the same time

Looking to finance my first new (used or certified preowned) car, with a budget of 15k, looking for something reliable that can fit a bigger framed individual such as myself (6'1 275).

I'm not too much of a car guy myself but I'm slowly learning as I go through the process of searching.

I'm looking for something a little bit newer around 2016 or 2017 

Any suggestions? (also anything fast is a bonus, ya boy likes to go fast)

The 2008 model has 214,000 km, priced at $8,000. The 2011 has $218,000, priced at $12,000. 

Are either of these cars worth going to look at? I know I want an ES350 and that people say they can be reliable up to 400,000 km and beyond. Is the 2008-2011 generation the same, or are there updates I'll be missing out on?

Hi all. Been shopping around for a while and I'm pretty torn.  


Need an SUV that fulfills these requirements to the best:

1. high tech/luxury features (need leather/non cloth)
2. good gas mileage
3. touch screen (no CX5)

I am looking for a midsize SUV either RWD but prefer AWD (live in snowy weather in winter). Looking at either used or new. If used I prefer under 40k miles, even less if it's German. Closest thing I've found to my liking is the Alfa Romeo Stelvio but have seen mixed reviews about it. Any ideas? 40k is my absolute limit here and would go as low as a 2017 model if everything is there.

Hey everyone,

My 2007 Saab 9-3 car is breaking down and I need to buy a new car asap. Looking to spend around 30k (max 35). Somewhat luxury is important to me, reliability and preferably something zippy/fun to drive. 

I was interested in Mazda 3, ford maverick (hybrid) but those are pretty much impossible to find anywhere near me, and I dont have the luxury of time to wait for a new order. 

Id prefer a sedan but not super opposed to crossovers/small suvs. I dont really like Hondas (ik theyre super reliable but just want something a little more unique) Any suggestions?

I'm looking at upgrading to a 3/4 ton due to getting a bigger camper. Camper in looking at is right under 9k dry. I live in TN so there are only a few grades I would tow up and they aren't that steep. I'm looking at either a 3v 6.8 or a 8.1 v8. I think a 6.0 gasser would be fine though but would like the Allison transmission. Out of the v10 or v8 which would yall choose? It will also be my daily driver and I know the mileage will not be the best on either but right now I'm only getting 13 in my 5.4 and 10 towing my current camper. Thanks in advance

I drive a 2012 Toyota RAV4 with 140k miles (have had it for 6 years now after graduating college). Im interested in upgrading to a new SUV like the Highlander, 4Runner, or some others. Is it worth paying the msrp over 40k right now or continue driving a car that is perfectly fine? I figured now is a good time to trade in my car as its estimated an absurd 12k on KBB, but would have to see what the trade-in value would actually be. Im not the most well-versed and knowledgeable in the car so anyones input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Just graduated from college, moving and making my first car purchase since Im going to need a car for work. Expecting to drive about 50 miles/day (when I signed they were remote but theyve since gone full RTO so Ill be commuting every day), living in the PNW. 

Im looking at used cars &lt;10 years old, &lt;100k miles, most important is reliability and fuel efficiency, hoping to drive whatever I buy for a while. Originally I was hoping to stay under $15k but with the market being so insane Im budgeting around $20k. My list right now is Honda Civic or Fit, Mazda3, Toyota Corolla, Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra or Altima, Hyundai Elantra. Anything I should add to the list, or anything that I should rule out?

Ive noticed a lot of the decent used models are going for the MSRP of the new models - are any of the above worth buying new if I could find one?

Hi all,

I'm looking at a few older wagons. Wanted to know what your thoughts are on these three. I have to drive an hour out before I see them each because that's how crazy this market is.

2008 Volvo XC70, $12.6k. 3.2 L engine, 89k miles, not much of a service history, 1 owner

2010 Jetta Sportwagen, $9k 2.5 engine, 86k miles, has a service history with fuel pump replaced at 60k, 1 minor accident, 2 owners

2008 Passat Komfort Wagon, $10k, 2.0t engine, 50 k miles, 1 corporate owner with just oil changes

I'm set on a wagon. Hate driving in SUV's and need space for a family of four. Not crazy about Subarus and how their CVTs and interiors feel. I love my Mazda 3 hatch but  too cramped. If the Mazda 6 wagon was in the US, I'd jump on it.

Hey everyone, so Im in the market for a new car and Im torn between an SUV or sedan. Bit of a background is Im a college student thats been driving my parents old Hyundai SantaFe since high school, but its time that I got my own car. I want an SUV because theyre higher off the ground than sedans, they feel less cramped, and its also just what Im used to driving. Ive budgeted it out, and my max price for the out-the-door cost of a car is going to have to be ~26k. In order to stay in budget. Ive been considering the Corolla sedan, the Kia Soul, and the new Corolla Cross.

The standard Corolla has low depreciation and repair costs and can most definitely last over 200k miles. The soul is a little ugly, but its the cheapest SUV I could find. It has higher repair costs than the corolla, loses about 50% of its value over 10 years, and probably cant make it to 200k. I dont know much about Kias but I know theyre not as good as Toyotas. Both the Soul and Corolla sedan would fit comfortably in my budget. The Corolla Cross was introduced this year and will max out my budget, and might honestly go over by a thousand dollars or so. Its a new car, so I havent been able to find much when it comes to depreciation, repair costs, or expected lifetime miles. It looks like a nice car but Im not sure I should take the chance on it. 

What do you think I should pick between the three? Should I take a chance on the Cross and go over budget? Accept that my car is going to be a little ugly and not as reliable as a Toyota and just get the soul? Or should I just suck it up and get the Corolla sedan? Are there any other budget SUVs that would fit my budget that I didnt mention?

TLDR: Im like SUVs more than sedans but sedans are cheaper. To stay in budget, should I get the Kia soul, suck it up and get the corolla, or should I go slightly over budget and get the Corolla  Cross?

I'm currently on the market for a new or used midsize SUV. Ideally I'm looking for luxury/utility with AWD. I do enjoy a higher ground clearance if possible.

* Mazda CX-5
* Subaru Forester

Any recommendations or thoughts?

So I think I'm about to buy a used 2018 outback limited here pretty soon. I love the look and the inside of outback and everyone I know that has a Subaru of any kind loves them. But I've also seen several articles saying that the 2018 model in particular is not very reliable, which surprised me. I've always thought of subaru as an extremely reliable brand. Do y'all have any experience with this? Are subarus less reliable than I thought? Is the 2018 model known to be one of the poorer models?

I've officially reached that point where my car repairs are more annually than a car payment would be. So I'm looking to sell my car and use it for a good down payment on something else. 
I know the used car market is not so great right now, but I can't help but notice the sheer amount of used Kia Souls that are for sale. Is there something about that model that I don't know? 

I think they come up on my searches because I love driving manual and I love a hatchback for the space.

I have been in the market for a new SUV, since my 2009 Ford Escape is starting to give. Around my budget, I stumbled across this 2014 Kia Sorento (link below). What is this groups feeling towards Kia? Worth the $ saving, or should I spend more on something else? Other options have been a 2015 RAV4, 2019 Chevy Equinox, 2015 Ford Edge. Thanks!

2016,2017 Toyota Camry or 
2016-2017 Honda Accord EX or 
2016-2018 Honda Civic Ex or

I am in Canada and with mark ups and everything right now because of the market I'm quoted 34k can for the civic ex and 30k for the corolla se, and 33k for an Elantra preferred but elantra I can get right away. The corolla is cheaper but I noticed it only has a flashing light for blindspot monitor where the others makes an audible sound when changing the lanes and something is approaching the blindspot area, my concern is if this would be less effective since it's just a flashing light and no audible sound makes it less attentive to bringing attention, I am a new first driver so a bit worried about this.

Hello all, 

This is my first time posting here, so I hope this kind of post is okay. As the title states, I'm 28 years old and will be a car owner for the first time. For those wondering why--long story short, I had  Amaxophobia (Fear of Driving). It was not as severe as some people, but I was terrified of driving as a kid, so I rejected any attempt at learning to drive. I've mostly overcome my fear over the years, and recently earned my license. 

Now onto buying a car for the first time. I'm old enough to understand basic car care/maintenance, responsibility and all that. I've lived with and been around a lot of people who gave me rides over the years and I've done hours and hours of research, so I have a decent knowledge on the subject. So, where I'm going with this is that I want to purchase a new vehicle, and not a used vehicle.

The market right now is obviously jacked, but I have the possibility of getting a good deal on a new 2022 Dodge Challenger SXT AWD (Around 35,000 walk out) and was wondering what you guys thought. I make 55,000 a year, and have 17,000 I can drop on a down payment comfortably. I've always loved the look of a Challenger and I've read that they are very reliable if you take care of them. When it comes to the gas mileage, I have a super short commute and don't have to travel much. Maybe 90 miles a week.

I know this is a long read, but I'd super appreciate some advice. Thanks.

So, if in the market for a new Luxury sedan.  I liked the Cadillac CT6, but it's no longer made. I want style, power and under 90k

So I'm thinking

Mercedes E

Genesis G90

Lexus LS 

Cadillac CT5 (a bit small for my taste), but I'd consider it

Audi A7, my favorite

Wildcard, Porche Panamera

Which one? and am I missing a decent alternative
-------------------------------

So Ive currently got a fairly clean 2008 Accord Coupe V6 EX-L 6-Speed Manual with 169k km, timing belt &amp; water pump have been done in last 5k km, its still on the original clutch and burns a bit of oil. Ive also got a 2002 Civic Coupe LX 5-Speed with 153k km, timing belt was done at 98k km, still on original clutch as well, but fully rebuilt suspension 10k km ago from previous owner (1700$ job). 

The accord has been my daily driver for about 2 years, I bought it for 5,000$ (its worth roughly 8,000$) but after a family friend offered me his civic for 3,000$ I decided to buy that and use it as a winter beater. I really love the accord, it has a great leather interior, lots of power, nice styling and an awesome gearbox, and I got it for such a great price. But gas prices  are getting pretty crazy, Im spending 155$ CAD per tank, and although I love the car, Id save a lot of money by selling it and driving the civic.

Ive been considering selling the accord and just using the civic as a daily, its much better on gas but so boring and slow. Being able to flip the accord and make some money would be nice too, but its just such a fun car. I just absolutely hate that it burns oil, I dont like having to fill the car up and always have it bugging me in the back of my mind. I fill it roughly once every 1200km (every 1.5 months), and it bugs me a lot. 

Can someone talk some sense into me, anyone been through a similar situation deciding between cheap vs fun cars?

Hello! I am looking at a 2013 Toyota Corolla with around 86k miles on it at a dealership tomorrow in Oregon.  They are asking $15,987 for it but I would like to talk them down to around 14.5k. Is this a decent deal or a least not a rip off in today market?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
So I own the civic. But I want the VW gti but dont know if this is dumb or not. 

The civic has 91k miles gti has 130k miles both are 5 speed manuals.

I bought the civic for 1k(insane) and could sell it for upwards of 4k. which would cover the cost of the gti.  do i do it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
161,000 miles, asking $4k. 
How reliable are these cars? How do I estimate how long a car will last me?

Ive found a 2015 Ford F-150 XLT for $22,900 with 45,167 miles on it. According to the private seller, it has a clean title. Im Its a flex fuel, not sure what that means.

Im 63 so it has definitely caught my eye but, to be honest, it seems to good to be true. Thoughts?

Im also a college student so with its MPG and gas prices nowadays, paying for gas is really worrying for me. I drive about 360 miles a month.

I am currently driving a 2019 Subaru Forester that is at the end of its lease. I thought that the car was owned when I "inherited" it, but a call from the bank said otherwise. So, I am unfortunately in the car market. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to move on to a different car. Preferably something with great mpg given gas prices and trying to stop global warming. I cannot do a plug in hybrid as I live in an apartment complex with no nearby plugins. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like something with a little bit more room than the Forester. I took the car camping a couple of times and I really maxed out the storage. I am also tall (6'7"), and would like to not be cramped if possible. I would love to buy a full size truck, but I would prefer something with better mpg.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like some offroad capabilities. I took my Forester on some fire trails and other light offroading getting to campgrounds. I would like to keep that possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have looked at the RAV4 hybrid and Hyundai Tucson hybrid. I would love to know of any other alternatives.

Need something 25k and under. I want something newer because safety features and comfort is a plus. I was looking at mazda because for some reason toyota and Honda have high markups. I found a grand touring cx5 for 2018 under 25k. Is this reasonable? Do you know  of anything as a better deal?
-------------------------------

I have one year left of college and I commute about 140 miles a week (work and school) and deal with moderate winters without a garage. I currently own an '04 Camry XLE, but deal with repairs around $2k-$3k/year (I still have around another $1k in unresolved repairs this year). I'm tired of always needing to be at the shop for a repair and that's the main reason why I want to upgrade my car at this point. But the other priority of mine is having an easier time with my winter commute.

I'm in the market for a mid-sized sedan. I'm going mid-sized because one, I have a midsized right now, and two, because I'm short asf and want to sit taller in my car (for reference, I already know I cannot see well out of a corolla or mazda3).   
I'm also thinking about ordering new because used cars are overpriced and some of my coworkers said that custom orders tend to be sold for MSRP. It just seems to be a smart option for the price, but maybe I'm wrong? I have the time to wait for an order, but hopefully can get something before winter hits. 

I was looking at Subaru Legacy in the Premium trim because it matches most of what my Camry has plus some modern features, and quiet a few useful climate features as well (heated mirrors, seats, wiper de-icer, AWD, etc). But the reliability and ranking scores have me a bit nervous about going with this option (seems to be bottom of the top for the mid-sized sedans).

I think this would be the max I'd let my budget go (so around $26k MSRP, pre-delivery fees). Not sure if there's any other cars in that range that would fit my needs and still offer around the same or more than my Camry? Am I over-thinking the rankings? Could I expect the Legacy to last 10-15 years? I'm hoping to finance and own it, will probably be around until I have kids. 

Just looking for some advice, thanks!

Leaning towards the 2017, i like the looks better.  The 2017 is a plane ride away but i can visit my sister on the way home type of thing.  not sure how to value 40k miles vs a newer model i like the looks of. I'd guess my plan is to keep the vehicle for a while unless electric vehicles really take off so resale isn't much concern at this point.

the 2017 is single owner with an accident at 60k miles in 6/2020:

* Damage reported: minor damage
*  Damage to rear
*  Damage to front
*  Damage to undercarriage
*  Damage to right front

good service records since the accident, i plan to have a PPI at a local mechanic before i buy it.  

the 2016 is closer, few hours away.  had an accident 12/2021 and that was bought by current dealer at 2/2022 and thats about it for records.

Hi all- I have 3 kids- one still in a booster- and am currently driving a gas-guzzling mini-van. I have 15k to spend on a used vehicle. I drive a ton, including long trips so there needs to be decent space. I am looking to get between 30-40mpg. Open to wagons, diesel, hybrids, anything but a sedan. Here's the fun part- my boyfriend is 6'7" tall and most Toyotas don't work for his height. I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations? Thanks!

What is important to me is the comfort of the ride and visibility.  I'm looking for a car for a single female driver. I will only use it for local roads and no freeway driving.  I had a Lexus IS 250 (2006).  Loved that one but I don't like the newer ones.  I'm looking for years 2017-2020.  It doesn't have to be luxury....test drove a Tesla and didn't like it.  Did like the 300 Mercedes...but am open to all foreign cars except Subaru.  This will probably be my last car.

Looking at buying used because of budget reasons but can't stomach the thought of paying ridiculous prices that used cars are selling for these days. How receptive are dealers to negotiating in today's used car sales market? Trying to save a few dollars any way I can during these rough economic times. My car's engine died so can't wait until prices go down and need a car for work/run errands

Still need a mechanic to check these out, but if both cars are mechanically sound, is there one I should choose above the other? The Mazda has a nice interior with leather seats and is manual, but am I crazy not to go with the Prius with gas prices increasing?

Im looking for a daily beater just to drive to work and occasionally run errands with wife. Im 65 470lbs

Which has:
Larger driver interior?
Easier to maintain and reliable?
Its about a 8 minute drive to work. I have a 2013 f250 diesel that Ive wasted way too much money on and just want to park.

I fit really comfortable in my wives 2011 Chevy traverse but Im just really interested in those two vehicles to mess with and they are cheap. Pilots go for 3k and highlanders 4k.

I even consider and old Honda Odyssey.

Hey so, Ive just turned 16 about 3 months ago and passed my G1 no problem, taking classes to lower insurance rates with a certificate and soon to get my G2. Ive been taking transportation tech meaning Ive been working on cars for about 2 years and I would really love to mod my first car just a little bit like the basics of intake, coil-overs and etc. 

Now here is the tricky part, Ive got only a 10k CAD budget and Im looking for JDMs since my dad encourages them way too much (unless you got a reliable model to recommend perhaps), and looking for a pretty reliable coupe, sedan, or hatchback that could be a pretty quick or fun car when stock, and of course Ive been taking a look at Mazda RX-8s, Infiniti G35/37s, Subaru Imprezas/WRX, or your typical BRZ/86/FRS. Any help on suggestions would mean a lot!

Ive been looking in the used car market but cant find anything thats not way overpriced, Ive got 8k right now I can use on a down payment, Im mostly just looking for something with good mpg thats reliable for a commuter car, any advice would be appreciated

This will be my first car, that I own, and after a bit of research I'm thinking of getting a used hybrid or plug-in. Pure electric is so expensive I'm not even going to bother, and I've heard they depreciate extremely quickly anyways. 

I'm currently driving a beater with horrible MPG. I'm spending nearly $150 a week in gas in my line of work, after compensation I'm still out around $50. Plus maintenance and insurance, nearly 15% of my total projected yearly income will just be paying for car stuff.

Backstory over, I was thinking of an old sedan/coup, but I don't know much about cars which is why I'm asking here. No must-havs except good mpg and repairability or reliability. Usage would be mostly city driving with little freeway use, 30-50 miles a day. I've seen used priuses for around 10K but they usually have 100k+ miles on them, which is concerning for me. I like the look of the ford fusion over a prius but I don't know about how you compare viability. My total budget is ~15k with financing.

Looking to tow a camper in the southeast for weekend trips. Won't be driving the vehicle daily just a tow vehicle. Looking at SUVs more than trucks as trucks are extremely expensive at this time.

I don't care about high mileage, used, or any features. Whatever will tow the best.

I would like to keep price near 15k.

Camper specs:
Weights
Dry Hitch Weight (lbs)	685
Unloaded Vehicle Weight (lbs)	5,400
Cargo Carrying Capacity (lbs)	1,600
Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (lbs)	7,000

Vehicles I am looking at. Open to any other models/makes. 

1. Ford Expedition (any models/years)
2. Lincoln version of Expedition
2. Infiniti QX80
3. Nissan Armada
4. 2500 Suburban if I can find one.
5. Ford Excursion if I can find one.

Hey everyone! Im a 24 yo F living in the city. I just accepted a new job ~30 minute drive from my apartment (mainly highway driving). I work 3 nights a week, 12.5 hour shifts.

Im here hoping I could get some advice from yall. My dad was my go to person to ask for car advice, but he passed away last year. Ive owned 2 cars in my life (one I bought for $800 cash from my dads friend, 1997 Honda Civic 175,000 miles), which lasted me until I was given my late grandmothers 1997 geo prism with 90,000 miles. 

So given youve made it this far in my post, you can tell Ive never really gone through the process of buying a big girl car, how to go about the process, refinancing, etc.  all I know is that I need either 4wd or awd since I live on the east coast and wanna be weather conscious when shit hits the fan in the winter time. Otherwise I have no idea where I should turn. I have a well paying job and good credit.  

If anyone has any insight or advice for my situation would be greatly appreciated :) feel free to PM me with any other questions. Thank you all in advance!

I'm an 18yo that lives in the United States and has taken up a recent interest in cars and car modding. I'm not currently looking to buy a car but if I were to buy a project car, I'd want something that isn't a miata (too many of them and I'm just not interested) or muscle cars like mustangs or camaros. Everything that I've seen as "beginner" project cars is expensive or not available in Florida near me. I wouldn't want to do any crazy mods. I'd want to do something like handling (something like sway bars and coilovers) or swapping the exhaust to make it sound better. Any suggests from the good people of reddit?

Hey all, I am currently seeking a bit of advice as it can be helpful to hear others viewpoints in a myriad of situations.  I will be starting college at the start of fall and am now planning to purchase a car. I live in the northeast and have been looking strenuously at the GR86 as my car, I would be driving 45 minutes to and from. However since I've been thinking I don't know if RWD will be good for me especially in NY snow, so I have been considering other options such as the Veloster N. Which car would you choose in my shoes and why. (Also if you have any other car considerations my budget is \~$35k and I'm looking for something sporty and practical).

My wife and I are in the market for a new car. We live in a northern state that has long winters and are planning to start our family soon. We would be replacing her 2012 Dodge Journey. She likes this size of vehicle. Our price range would be in the upper 20s, potentially even low $30s. What sort of car should we look into?

Situation: My wife, new born child, and I will be moving to the US by the end of the year. Considering the low inventories and wait time for new cars, we are thinking ahead and might place an order in advance. We would only have one car, as Im planning to commute using public transportation.

Whats important to us?: as mentioned, we have a new born baby and the grandparents will want to visit often. Reliability, fuel efficiency, and resale value are also important points for us.

Options: so far we are considering 4 cars

1. Kia Telluride: pros - 3rd row, looks great, nice interior, very popular model with high ratings. Cons - long wait times and potential price premiums, not very fuel efficient, unsure about long term reliability/resale value.

2. Toyota Highlander hybrid: pros - reliability and resale value, 3rd row, fuel efficient. Cons - not the most exciting design, limited 3rd row seat space, higher price tag.

3. VW Tiguan: pros - 3rd row seat, lower price tag, nice exterior design, ok fuel efficiency. Cons - limited 3rd row space, unsure about reliability and resale value.

4. Toyota RAV4 hybrid: pros - reliability and resale value, fuel efficient, very popular car, lower price tag. Cons - no 3rd row seat

Would appreciate your opinions. Thanks in advance!

Hey everyone!

So Im currently in a 2017 Porsche 718 Cayman S with 29k miles and am possibly looking to get into something AWD that I can daily all seasons since Im in Illinois. 

An RS3 was the car I had at the top of my list, and my Audi dealer just got in a 2019 Nardo Grey with 16k miles, black optic package, tech package, dynamic package, and driver assistance package. Tested it yesterday and wasnt completely sold on it. Definitely enjoyed it, but its a completely different car than my Cayman, so I have to wrap my head around the driving experience some more. 

I would love to hear from other RS3 owners, their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the car and how its been to own one. 

Other car suggestions are definitely welcome!

Thanks!

I am in the market to buy a car, and the two main cars I have been looking at are a 2017 Toyota Prius3 with 32k mi priced at $19,900, and a brand new 2022 Toyota Corolla LE priced at $21,899. I will mainly use the car for driving to and from school and my job, and I am in college and a nursing student so it may be a good amount of driving. I like how the Prius is a hybrid car, and I have wanted one ever since I started looking for a car, but I am hoping for an outsider opinion. Is it more worth it to buy the brand new Corolla rather than the used Prius?
-------------------------------

Title. Have narrowed it down between the two. Keeping the budget within 30-40k. I realize both are quite different cars with the lexus being a lot more luxury and the golf being more sporty. I plan on getting an automatic. The car will be my daily that I will use for 8-10 years and both seem quite practical. Which would you choose and why? Would the Golf GTI MK8 being brand new be comparable to a ~2019 ~20-30k miles IS 350 in terms of long term reliability? If there are any other cars you would consider buying within this budget let me know. 

Also - I realize that the infotainment is a huge turn-off for a lot of people and understandably so. Personally I quite like the MK8 infotainment which is also why I am not a big fan of the Lexus infotainment (that is quite dated at this point and will be even more so down the line). I'd consider modding the infotainment of the IS 350 and replacing it with one that has apple carplay. Cheers.

I am looking at purchasing a car for myself, this is going to be my first car but I've driven a car with manual transmission for at least 4 years in India (tight roads - good driving skills)

I absolutely do not have any preferences except for driver engagement and fun. I've test driven 2022 WRX, steering felt barely engaging, didn't know where the tyres were. Short throw shifter(optional package) was icky and the car was new so I felt the accelerator to be a bit rubber bandy for some reason. I've been looking into Civic Si, Elantra N too, all 2022 models. Hate VW. Otherwise would've included VW Jetta GLI.

I am leaning towards the Civic and Elantra N more because of driving experience and more towards the Elantra N because it has crazy customization on suspension, in particular to fit the mood!

Couldn't get my hands on Civic Si or Elantra N to test drive yet!

Let me know, folks

Hey Reddit. Question for you all. My grandfather has tasked me with helping him buy a new car. Hes wanting a new hybrid but essentially has no other requirements. Is the 2022 Prius still the best option? Hes coming from a 1995 Honda Civic coupe so anything will be an upgrade. Budget would be under $35k.

I have already made a post about if a jeep wrangler is a good first car but I got mixed responses. Where I live 4wd comes in handy very often, and I want something that I can beat up. I plan to do a lot of work on the car( just basic maintenance stuff like brake changes and replacing fluids) and I want something that can handle it. and one last question is if I should get a manual or automatic transmission. my drive to school is not very far so it doesn't have to be the most fuel-efficient either. TLDR whats a good first car that is 4wd and can take a beating

Looking at the 2022 Telluride S or the 2023 Odyssey EXL. Telluride is marked up about 4K.

In the market for a larger car. I'm 6'4, been driving a 2013 Scion xB for 2 years. Much too small.

Been looking at full size SUV's and stumbled upon the Lincoln Navigator. I like most of the models after the 2011. Anyone have any advice on this make/model? How much are repairs? Do they have regular maintenance or recall issues? Other similar size suggestions?

Good gas mileage (for an SUV) is not a priority as I don't drive that far. Leather interior is somewhat important as I'd like to be able to take my dog with me when needed and he's very hairy. 

Haven't decided on firm budget, but with financing I'd be willing to spend around 25-28k.

Thank you all!

Liked both cars on test drives. 5 year cost of ownership for both cars is extremely comparable as well. Only thing I am worried about is the GTI breaking down. Personally know 2 people whose GTIs just died out of nowhere, so a bit worried about their higher repair/maintenance costs being a VW.

I have 2 kids and we make about 10 couple of hours  weekend trips per year. My wife loves Hyundai Palisade Limited and I am more conservative and like the Sienna XLE.  The vehicle will be driven about 15-17k miles each year. Does the mpg make the Sienna the obvious winner or better to keep the wife happy? She wants a new vehicle but will not file for divorce if we go Toyota.

So I was involved in a hit-and-run a few nights ago. Damage itself wasn't bad but 4 airbags deployed, repairs were 13k, so now I'm suddenly looking at getting a new car. I'm only somewhat informed on what brands that aren't the best and what might be better, so I definitely need some guidance. Especially since the car I lost was a shitbag I put more into than my loan was worth. 

So my main point is, what are some reliable used vehicles? I'm not really looking for something super cheap like a Yaris, so much as good bang for my buck that will have long term reliability and not have common huge car issues (like the Chevy Cruze I had T\_T). My budget is 18k, I want a regular sized vehicle but I'm open to hatchbacks, not a huge fan of Nissans or anything with a CVT. 

Not really looking for anything special to the point where I wouldn't even care if it had hand crank windows, just something that runs well for a long time. I've heard Camrys are good?? 

The vehicles I see most for sale are like Ford Focus/Fiesta, Hyundai Elantra, Chevy Spark. So I'm just curious what is least problematic. 

I appreciate any feedback :)

Need a car for a couple of years. Looking at a 2011 Cruze for $5K, at 145K mileage. (Haven't seen the car yet)

I just ordered a car from Carvana that should be delivered next week. I want to get a pre-purchase inspection done right away so I can make sure I have plenty of time to do whatever I might need to do within their 7 day time frame. But, I don't have a trusted mechanic to take it to since I haven't had a car in a while or even in this state.

Where should I bring the car to have it checked out? I realize that's a specific question so I will ask this as well: what should I look for in a shop/mechanic that would be a good sign that I could trust their work/judgement? Are there any places I should avoid? (There's a jiffy lube right next to my work, for instance... but I kinda know the manager there) 

Secondly, and excuse me for sounding a bit ignorant with this one, what potential issues would be serious enough that it should warrant returning the vehicle, if found?

Just in case, the car I ordered is a 2014 Mazda3 with about 100k miles. Carfax report shows no accidents or anything.

So family is getting bigger and I need something that drives people around. With gas prices as they are I was looking into the hybrid SUV/Van to offset this.

Only 2 vans I saw with hybrid tech is the Pacifica or the Sienna. 

I would consider a SUV if it wasn't a pain in the ass to get into the back with 2 car seats taking up the middle.

So.... is the Pacifica a good choice?

Hi everyone! So I currently have a 2005 Pontiac Sunfire and Im looking to upgrade. 

I want to try and stay around the $5k(CAD) mark it possible. It will be my daily driver, and I am going to college in September. 

Im a fan of JDM cars. I really like Honda too. I have a 97 Prelude as a project but Im selling it currently due to the timing and not having a place long term to keep it :/. I would like to get something Japanese as I really love these cars, but Id consider venturing into German cars too. 

I have no specific needs. I would like something manual, and that looks nice. I want something thats fun to drive. That I want to go out and drive. It doesnt need to be fast, but just feel fun. I want something that will be comfortable and nice to drive on a long road trip as I want to start exploring a lot more. So if I go for a 8 hour road trip I will enjoy it in this car. Cause in my Sunfire I hate even driving to town in it haha. 

I was really considering a 04-08 Acura TSX, or TL as it checks almost all the boxes. I think they can look pretty nice, there decent on gas, have some pep, have a sunroof(huge plus!), and if you get the tech package you get, well, tech! and they look comfy asf to drive. But, with the current gas prices, and a car that wants premium fuel, idk I kind of turned myself off of them due to the premium fuel need. But Im sort of still considering. 

What would you guys recommend? I wish integras werent so expensive now! If I went German, Id probably only really consider Volkswagen. I also dont really want anything RWD. Due to living in a super hilly part of Canada, the winter with all the hills would suck. Just dont want the headache haha. 

Any advice is thanked!

Hi!

I'm a college student buying my first car. My budget is 5k, but obviously something under budget would be awesome. I like small hatchbacks, and because the Yaris has a great mpg, I'm considering it. The catch is that it has 183k miles on it. I'm getting conflicted opinions about whether or not to consider it and check it out. What do you guys think? I don't know anyone who's had a Yaris so I have no anecdotal experience on it.
-------------------------------

Im 20, have been driving a 1.6 Ford Fiesta as my first car but want to upgrade to something with a bit more power, been looking at MX5s and Celicas. Any other suggestions?

Hey all, so I have a choice between a new 2022 Golf GTI and a 2021 Arteon SEL R-Line. Both are damn near identical when it comes to price. 

I plan on keeping one of them for a couple years. Im downgrading from an Acura RDX To reduce my payments a bit. 

So was wondering for the same price a low mile Arteon or should I go for a GTI.

112k miles. Drove smooth as hell. No lights on the dash. Is 2,000 $ a decent deal? Looking to get out of my shitty financed car and into a beater I can own for a few years.

Im in the market for a truck and this will be my first truck. I dont do any off-roading or trailer hauling so I dont need a 4x4. These two trucks caught my eye because they are on more of the luxury end I guess you can say. Im just looking for a truck that rides smooth and has good power for getting on the freeway and around people and when having to make a right turn on a light. Both engines have the 3.5L v6 turbo. That being said which truck would you recommend? 
Thanks for your time.

Seems like a good deal. Would prefer a manual but could live with the DSG. Timing chain repair just finished 1 month back. No rust. Mostly stock (intake + exhaust). Thoughts ?

I am interested in buying a 1991 Mitsubishi Lancer 1500 GLXI and would like to know what should I consider other than, possible rust on the roof, electronics failing and plastics breaking. I was told many times to look after newer cars, however they just cannot pick my interest. I often heard about this generation of Lancer, being fuel efficient and reliable. Although the car in question looks almost as if it was new, both inside and outside, it has over 340.000 km in it. After buying it I would like to check every single part of it and if really needed, change them. It costs 1200$.

It would not be the first car I have ever owned but the first car I would buy myself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
2016 Elantra 128k miles 9500

2011 civic 120k miles 9000


Ive found that I can get newer elantras for the same price of older civics and Corollas (around 12k is the budget) 

Only thing is that used Elantras have tons of miles and idk if thats an issue

Hey,

My car was recently totaled so I need to get a new one. It was a 2009 Toyota Yaris, which I liked for a number of reasons, namely the decent mileage, reliability, and hatchback. 

I was struggling to come up with a decent replacement and was hoping for some help. The Yaris was a little small for me as a person and I would enjoy something a little sportier, but other than that I'm a bit lost. I'm in SoCal, with a budget of 15k. I'd like to have 30+ mpg and the reliability are the highest priorities for me. Size, fun to drive, and hatchback are nice-to-haves, but not dealbreakers. Automatic/Manual doesn't matter.
-------------------------------

I know, the answer is always Miata, but someone please convince me not to buy one. 

I'm looking at a couple early 90's Miata NA's in the 100-150k miles, $5-8k range. Kind of dissapointed I just missed the days of super cheap $2k Miatas but I really love the popup headlights and I think I'm at a point in my life where the downsides I always hear about Miatas don't matter to me.

"Don't get one if it's your only car." This will be my first car, but for about the next month and a half, I'll still be living with my parent's for the summer and am able to borrow their car if something goes wrong and I need to fix it up for a bit. When I go back to school, I won't be driving it as much and if something goes wrong, I've gone 3 whole years of college without one so I'll just be back where I was. 

"They suck to daily." I'm moving back to school in a month and a half and I'll only be daily-ing it to work for that much longer. When I'm at school I only see myself driving it weekly or bi-weekly. 

"They are dangerous and unsafe." Yeah I'll give you that one. But if I don't drive it every day for the next year that can't be that big of a deal right? I could just install a roll bar? 

"They are impractical." Only having one extra seat isn't great.

&amp;#x200B;

An old Civic or a Prius would probably be the safer, easier to drive, more responsible choice, but the Miata has popup headlights, and I can get better at driving stick with it. 

I don't know if I'm looking for someone to sell me on a Civic/Prius or tell me the Miata is the answer, but any input from whatcarshouldibuy would be much appreciated.

I'm on a 15K budget (will go higher if i have to.) I like things like the mazda RX7, mazda MX5, nissan silvia, 370z's. But also things like the golf but I really don't know what car i should go for or if you guys have any other suggestions.

Last question, I'll be posting lol. Another option is an SUV, would it be worth it or probably not? Figured it's cheap plus it's big, not too high miles, but how's the reliability?  Clean carfax. I'm good at keeping up with routine maintenance just don't know too much about it. I just can't afford too too much so I'm giving myself options.

Found a clean one in marketplace, got the price down to 12.5k.

everything is good about it except that it had an engine swap to a k24. 

290 on the body and 135 on the new engine

Nissan has 49k Miles for 19,500 and Mazda has about 34,000 Miles for about 20,000$ MSRP. Any of these worth it? Looking for reliability, with something that'll be a bit fun. Not looking for anything Overpowered ya know?

I've been looking at some vehicles for my next car:

- 22 civic hatch touring
- 23 acura integra aspec
- 23 corolla cross xle
- 22 accord sport 2.0

I'm pretty tall at 185cm and currently drive an old civic. I haven't had a chance to sit in any of them except for the accord. Its crazy how dealers don't have a model you can even sit in right now. The biggest things I've been looking for are:

- lumbar support, comfortable and quiet cabin
- good mpg
- decent cargo space
- good driver assist features/tech
- under/around 35K OTD

I've looked at the mazda cx-5 and 50 but found the non touchscreen and the driver assist not that good. The crosstrek is missing lumbar support but it checks off everything else I would want. Otherwise, I'd be getting either of those.

One of the questions I've been thinking is why get an SUV if I can find a sedan with similar cargo and seating, but it is missing the ground clearance? Yet the sedans get better mpg? Does the height help with seating/ride comfort?

looking to buy in 6months-year. torn between the 3.0 GR Supra and M4. the rcf is kind of like option c because its slower and harder to tune, (more of a GT not sports car) but i love that v8 sound and how it looks.

Alright, so me and the wifey have pretty much given up on getting a RAV 4 Prime. The RAV 4 Hybrid is still potentially an option... though we wouldn't necessarily get the car we want. We'd have to pick from the dealerships allotment. This has led us to look into other vehicles outside of the RAV 4 but honestly we are a little overwhelmed.

We looked at the Escape Plug in Hybrid this past weekend and liked it... but from the research we've done seems like Ford's quality may be questionable. 

Anyone have any insight? I've searched the sub and found a ton of information on this topic. Seems like the general consensus is Toyota is the way to go but its looking like this won't be an option for us.

We drive about 15K miles a year. AWD and ground clearance are important to us - mainly for harder to reach trailheads.
